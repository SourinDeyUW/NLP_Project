"A series of naphthalene diimide (NDI) based n-type conjugated polymers with amino-functionalized side groups and backbones were synthesized and used as cathode interlayers (CILs) in polymer and perovskite solar cells. Because of controllable amine side groups, all the resulting polymers exhibited distinct electronic properties such as oxidation potential of side chains, charge carrier mobilities, self-doping behaviors, and interfacial dipoles. The influences of the chemical variation of amine groups on the cathode interfacial effects were further investigated in both polymer and perovskite solar cells. We found that the decreased electron-donating property and enhanced steric hindrance of amine side groups substantially weaken the capacities of altering the work function of the cathode and trap passivation of the perovskite film, which induced ineffective interfacial modifications and declining device performance. Moreover, with further improvement of the backbone design through the incorporation of a rigid acetylene spacer, the resulting polymers substantially exhibited an enhanced electron-transporting property. Upon use as CILs, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.1% and 15.2% were, respectively, achieved in polymer and perovskite solar cells. Importantly, these newly developed n-type polymers were allowed to be processed over a broad thickness range of CILs in photovoltaic devices, and a prominent PCE of over 8% for polymer solar cells and 13.5% for perovskite solar cells can be achieved with the thick interlayers over 100 nm, which is beneficial for roll-to-roll coating processes. Our findings contribute toward a better understanding of the structure–performance relationship between CIL material design and solar cell performance, and provide important insights and guidelines for the design of high-performance n-type CIL materials for organic and perovskite optoelectronic devices."
"In this work, two novel polymeric semiconductors (D2 and D3), with perfluorinated side chains in their backbone, were developed. Moreover, a novel small molecule (D1), with a similar structure to polymers D2 and D3, was also designed for comparison purposes. Compounds D1–D3 were successfully synthesized, completely characterized and used as additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The novel materials contain 26 fluorine atoms per unit, which is the largest amount of fluorine atoms reported for additives in PSCs. In this regard, D1–D3 were incorporated into the perovskite layer as additives and their effect on the film formation, stability and performance of PSCs was studied. As a result, D1–D3-based devices showed very good performances comparable to devices fabricated without additives and an increased stability. Thus, D1- and D2-fabricated devices retained 94 and 85% of their initial power, respectively, after 80 min under a bias, while the reference devices broke down completely. These results illustrate the extraordinary protective action of the perfluorinated polymers against humidity and oxygen, even at a low concentration of 2 mg ml−1 used in our experiments."
"The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) largely depends on the crystal grain size of perovskite films. Here, we use the mixture of n-octyltrimethoxysilane (OTES) and aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTES) to tailor the surface termination state of SnO2 electron transport layer, and demonstrate the crystal grain size of perovskite is remarkably enlarged. The perovskite film with large crystal size shows a lower non-radical recombination density and a longer charge lifetime. The power conversion efficiency of PSCs is eventually improved from 18.21% to 20.3%. The proposed method may also impact other optoelectronic devices based perovskite films."
"Two-dimensional (2D) metal-halide perovskites with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) have demonstrated great potential in photovoltaics. The balance between stability and efficiency could be tailored by varying the distance between the inorganic slabs. However, the efficiencies are still low due to the low carrier mobility and random crystal orientation in the defective ACI films. Furthermore, how the ACI multidimensional perovskites assembled in the solution-processed film is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrated nanoscale hybrid multidimensional (GA)(MA)3Pb3I10 ACI (guanidinium = GA, methylammonium = MA) perovskite with vertically stacked microcrystals and preferential crystal orientation. In each microcrystal, the low-dimensional ACI are assembled within 3D perovskite nanoscale networks. Such nanoscale heterojunctions prompt ultrafast (~0.3 ps) charge carrier localization from ACI to 3D perovskite and the subsequent efficient charge carrier extraction from the 3D networks to the extraction layers. Based on optimized ACI films, record high-efficiency (>16%) and high-stability planar perovskite cells are achieved. Our results provide new insight into the crystal growth and carrier kinetics of the ACI perovskite solar cells."
"Low-temperature solution-processed SnO2-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, but they still suffer from a critical drawback due to the defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. Herein, we report a facile acetic acid post-treatment strategy to effectively passivate the surface defects. With an optimal concentration of acetic acid, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the planar-type triple cation PSCs is greatly increased from 18.57% to 20.33%. The champion device shows a PCE of 20.56%. In addition, the universality of this passivation strategy is double confirmed by achieving an enhanced average PCE from 19.52% to 21.64% for sequential method deposited dual cation PSCs, with a leading PCE of 21.95%. Our work demonstrates an effective passivation strategy for SnO2-based planar-type PSCs, which will benefit the development of high-efficiency PSCs."
"Hybrid perovskite compounds as methylammonium lead halides are currently been investigated for different optoelectronic applications. CH3NH3PbBr3 is a promising member because of its electronic structure and large bandgap that gives rise to a high open circuit voltage. Although higher performances can result by using sophisticated processing, one-step methods are particularly interesting because of their easy implementation. Solar cells based on CH3NH3PbBr3 are fabricated using one-step spin coating deposition. Remarkable effect on the morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties is observed by changing the molar ratio of the precursors. "
"we reported the that the crystallinity and grain size of perovskite films could be systematically tailored by modulating the stoichiometry of the precursor solution in the hot-casting process under ambient condition with a relative humidity of 40%. It was found that a slight excess of methylammonium iodide (MAI) in the precursor solution could effectively compensate the MAI loss due to the high substrate temperature. A significant increase in the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite film was observed together with a decrease in defect density and a carrier concentration enhancement in MAI-rich samples. The corresponding devices exhibited a notable increase in fill factor (up to 80.70%) and short-circuit current density. In addition, in MAI-deficient samples, an enrichment of PbI2 at the grain boundaries was directly observed by optical microscopy and laser confocal microscopy. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed an increase in the charge carrier lifetime in the MAI-deficient samples, which was in line with the previous results with a small amount of excess PbI2 in the perovskite film. This work highlights a new strategy to prepare high-quality perovskite thin films with excellent crystal quality under ambient condition."
"Tin-based perovskites have exhibited high potential for efficient photovoltaics application due to their outstanding optoelectrical properties. However, the extremely undesired instabilities significantly hinders their development and further commercialization process. A novel tin-based reduced-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites is reported here by using 5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA+) as the organic spacer. It is demonstrated that by introducing appropriate amount of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as additive, highly vertically oriented tin-based quasi-2D perovskite films are obtained, which is proved through the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering characterization. In particular, this approach is confirmed to be a universal method to deliver highly vertically oriented tin-based quasi-2D perovskites with various spacers. The highly ordered vertically oriented perovskite films significantly improve the charge collection efficiency between two electrodes. With the optimized NH4Cl concentration, the solar cells employing quasi-2D perovskite, AVA2FAn−1SnnI3n+1 (<n> = 5), as light absorbers deliver a power conversion efficiency up to 8.71%. The work paves the way for further employing highly vertically oriented tin-based quasi-2D perovskite films for highly efficient and stable photovoltaics."
"To improve the photovoltaic performance (both efficiency and stability) in hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells, perovskite lattice distortion is investigated with regards to residual stress (and strain) in the polycrystalline thin films. It is revealed that residual stress is concentrated at the surface of the as-prepared film, and an efficient method is further developed to release this interfacial stress by A site cation alloying. This results in lattice reconstruction at the surface of polycrystalline thin films, which in turn results in low elastic modulus. Thus, a “bone-joint” configuration is constructed within the interface between the absorber and the carrier transport layer, which improves device performance substantially. The resultant photovoltaic devices exhibit an efficiency of 21.48% with good humidity stability and improved resistance against thermal cycling."
"Spiro-linked compounds have been used as benchmark hole-transport materials (HTMs) for the construction of efficient normal architecture (n-i-p) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the heavy reliance on the use of dopants not only complicates the device fabrication but imposes long-term stability concern of the devices. Herein, it is reported that solution-processed dopant-free spiro molecules can serve as superior HTMs to fabricate efficient inverted (p-i-n) PSCs. Rational choice of orthogonal solvent allows us to solution deposit uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films without compromising the hole-extraction capability of the spiro-based interface layers. To illustrate the generality of the strategy, three spiro-linked molecules are investigated side by side as HTMs in one-step solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. Due to the favored energy-level alignment and high hole mobility, solar cells based on the HTM of spiro-TTB yield a high efficiency of 18.38% with open-circuit voltages (VOC) up to 1.09 V. These results suggest that small molecular HTMs commonly developed for normal structure devices can be of great potential to fabricate cost-effective and highly efficient inverted PSCs."
"The all-inorganic α-CsPbI3 perovskite with superb thermal stability and suitable band gap for light harvesting has been considered as a promising candidate for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the photoactive black α-CsPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable and transforms spontaneously into nonphotoactive yellow δ-phase at room temperature. Herein, a facile method is reported to prepare α-CsPbI3 perovskite films with high stability at room temperature by mixing a small amount of ascorbic acid (AA) in the CsPbI3 precursor solutions. It is revealed that the interaction of AA with the CsPbI3 precursors could effectively inhibit the rapid crystallization of CsPbI3 and reduce the size of the coordination colloidal, and thus decrease the grain size of CsPbI3 for preparing long-term stable α-CsPbI3 films. "
"Perovskite silicon tandem solar cells are a promising technology to overcome the efficiency limit of silicon solar cells. Although highest tandem efficiencies have been reported for the inverted p-i-n structure, high-efficiency single junction perovskite solar cells are mostly fabricated in the regular n-i-p architecture. In this work, regular n-i-p perovskite solar cells with a high-bandgap mixed cation mixed halide absorber suitable for tandem solar cells are investigated by compositional engineering and the open-circuit voltage is improved to over 1.12 V using a passivating electron contact. The optimized perovskite solar cell is used as a top cell in a monolithic perovskite silicon tandem device with a silicon heterojunction bottom cell allowing for voltages up to 0.725 V. The tandem solar cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2 achieve record open-circuit voltages of up to 1.85 V and have efficiencies over 20%. Analyzing the perovskite absorber by spatially resolved photoluminescence measurements shows a homogenous and stable emission at ~ 1.7 eV which is an optimal value for tandem applications with silicon. The tandem solar cells are mainly limited due to a low current. A spectrometric characterization reveals that the perovskite solar cell is current limiting which could be improved by a thicker perovskite absorber."
"Stability and scalability have become the two main challenges for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the research focus in the field advancing toward commercialization. One of the prerequisites to solve these challenges is to develop a cost-effective, uniform, and high quality electron transport layer that is compatible with stable PSCs. Sputtering deposition is widely employed for large area deposition of high quality thin films in the industry. Here the composition, structure, and electronic properties of room temperature sputtered SnO2 are systematically studied. Ar and O2 are used as the sputtering and reactive gas, respectively, and it is found that a highly oxidizing environment is essential for the formation of high quality SnO2 films. With the optimized structure, SnO2 films with high quality have been prepared. It is demonstrated that PSCs based on the sputtered SnO2 electron transport layer show an efficiency up to 20.2% (stabilized power output of 19.8%) and a T80 operational lifetime of 625 h. Furthermore, the uniform and thin sputtered SnO2 film with high conductivity is promising for large area solar modules, which show efficiencies over 12% with an aperture area of 22.8 cm2 fabricated on 5 × 5 cm2 substrates (geometry fill factor = 91%), and a T80 operational lifetime of 515 h."
"Herein, a mixed anti-solvent treatment by spraying acetonitrile (ACN)-added chlorobenzene (CBZ) for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films is proposed. While the lower-boiling-point ACN preserves the morphology of the perovskite film, it has a significant impact on perovskite crystallization dynamics. While CBZ is responsible for facilitating nucleation, ACN performs two functions. ACN as a weak polarity solvent allows the organic salt in the perovskite complex to be redissolved for perovskite formation and loosens the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–PbI2 bond for more rapid perovskite crystallization. For the mixed anti-solvent treatment to be successful, an appropriate amount of ACN is the key and the use of spraying to dispense the mixed anti-solvent is crucial. This is due to the more instant and rapid reaction caused by the ACN which is faster than spreading the ACN across the substrate by the spinning motion. The resultant film using an appropriate mixed anti-solvent treatment is a pinhole-free high-quality perovskite film with larger grain and enhanced crystallinity compared with CBZ-only treatment film."
"Defect passivation using oxygen has been identified as an efficient and convenient approach to suppress nonradiative recombination and improve the photovoltaic performance of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites (HHPs). However, oxygen can seriously undermine the chemical stability of HHPs due to the reaction of superoxide with protonated organic cations such as CH3NH3+ and [(NH2)2CH]+, thus hindering the deep understanding of how oxygen affects their defect properties. Here we substitute free-proton inorganic Cs+ for organic moiety to avoid the negative effect of oxygen and then systematically investigate the oxygen passivation mechanism in all-inorganic halide perovskites (IHPs) from theory to experiment. We find that, in contrast to conventional oxygen molecule passivation just through physisorption on the surface of perovskites, the oxygen atom can provide a better passivation effect due to its stronger interaction with perovskites. The key point to achieve O-passivated perovskites rather than O2 is the dry-air processing condition, which can dissociate the O2 into O during the annealing process. O-passivated IHP solar cells exhibit enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better air stability than O2-passivated cells. These results not only provide deep insights into the passivation effect of oxygen on perovskites but also demonstrate the great potential of IHPs for high photovoltaic performance with simplified ambient processing."
"Chemical doping of inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites is an effective way of improving the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we use 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (AVAI) to chemically stabilize the structure of α-FAPbI3. Using solid-state MAS NMR, we demonstrate the atomic-level interaction between the molecular modulator and the perovskite lattice and propose a structural model of the stabilized three-dimensional structure, further aided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find that one-step deposition of the perovskite in the presence of AVAI produces highly crystalline films with large, micrometer-sized grains and enhanced charge-carrier lifetimes, as probed by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, we achieve greatly enhanced solar cell performance for the optimized AVA-based devices with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94%. The devices retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 300 h under continuous white light illumination and maximum-power point-tracking measurement."
"MXenes are a large and rapidly expanding family of 2D materials that, owing to their unique optoelectronic properties and tunable surface termination, find a wide range of applications including energy storage and energy conversion. In this work, Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets are applied as a novel type of electron transport layer (ETL) in low-temperature processed planar-structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Interestingly, simple UV-ozone treatment of the metallic Ti3C2Tx that increases the surface TiO bonds without any change in its bulk properties such as high electron mobility improves its suitability as an ETL. Improved electron transfer and suppressed recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface results in augmentation of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5.00% in the case of Ti3C2Tx without UV-ozone treatment to the champion PCE of 17.17%, achieved using the Ti3C2Tx film after 30 min of UV-ozone treatment. As the first report on the use of pure MXene layer as an ETL in PSCs, this work shows the great potential of MXenes to be used in PSCs and displays their promise for applications in photovoltaic technology in general."
"Photostability is one of the most vital challenges for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). With the incorporation of black phosphorus (BP), well known for self-healing and its superior property to regulate charge recombination, into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites (MAPbI3/BP), the associated PSCs exhibit significant enhancement in photostability in addition to the photovoltaic (PV) performance. The MAPbI3/BP-based PSCs retain ≈94% of initial efficiency after 1000 h continuous white light LED illumination in a dry N2 glovebox whereas their counterparts without the incorporation of BP decrease to ≈30%. Although BP has very small influence on the morphology and structure of the perovskite crystals, Pb0 defects are effectively inhibited and hot carrier recombination is found to be retarded as confirmed by femtosecond optical spectroscopy. The utilization of the material to simultaneously inhibit Pb0 defect formation and retard charge recombination, such as BP, is a promising strategy to enhance the photostability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based PSCs and their siblings."
"A series of spiro-arranged hole-transporting materials are designed and synthesized by incorporating a substituted phenylpyrazole unit to the orthogonal dibenzosuberene core unit, which are named as THY-1 to THY-5. All of them exhibit good optical, electrochemical, and electronic properties as needed for HTMs, despite the distinctive morphologies observed for the spin-casted thin film. A perovskite solar cell based on THY-5 exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency of 15.83%, which is comparable to that of the N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine (Spiro-OMeTAD) reference device (16.22%) fabricated using identical architecture."
"Improving the quality of the perovskite active layer is crucial to obtaining high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, by introducing formic acid into the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) precursor solution, we managed to achieve reduced colloidal size in the solution, leading to more uniform deposition of FAPbI3 film with lower trap state density and higher carrier mobility. The solar cells based on the FAPbI3 absorber layer modified with formic acid show significantly better photovoltaic performance than that on the reference FAPbI3 film without formic acid. The device performance shows a close correlation with the colloidal size. Within the range studied from 6.7 to 1.0 nm, the smaller the colloidal size is, the higher the solar cell efficiency. More specifically, the cell efficiency is improved from 17.82% for the control cell without formic acid to 19.81% when 0.764 M formic acid was used. Formic acid has also been added into a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) precursor solution, which exhibits a similar effect on the resulting MAPbI3 films and solar cells, with efficiency improved from 16.07% to 17.00%."
"Solar-grade single or multiple crystalline wafers are needed in large quantities in the solar cell industry, and are generally formed by a top-down process from crystal ingots, which causes a significant waste of materials and energy during slicing, polishing, and other processing. Here, a bottom-up technique that allows the growth of wafer-size hybrid perovskite multiple crystals directly from aqueous solution is reported. Single-crystalline hybrid perovskite wafers with centimeter size are grown at the top surface of a perovskite precursor solution. As well as saving raw materials, this method provides unprecedented advantages such as easily tunable thickness and rapid growth of the crystals. These crystalline wafers show high crystallinity, broader light absorption, and a long carrier recombination lifetime, comparable with those of bulk single crystals. Lateral-structure perovskite solar cells made of these crystals demonstrate a record power conversion efficiency of 5.9%."
"Large-area polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with variably sized moth-eye structures were fabricated to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. An approach that incorporated photolithography, bilayer PDMS deposition and replication was used in the fabrication process. By simply attaching the moth-eye PDMS films to the transparent substrates of perovskite solar cells, the optical properties of the devices could be tuned by changing the size of the moth-eye structures. The device with 300-nm moth-eye PDMS films greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency of ~ 21% due to the antireflective effect of the moth-eye structure. Furthermore, beautiful coloration was observed on the 1000-nm moth-eye PDMS films through optical interference caused by the diffraction grating effect. Our results imply that moth-eye PDMS films can greatly enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and building-integrated photovoltaics"
"Fully converting the lead salt to perovskite is crucial for the performance of the perovskite solar cells via the sequential deposition method. By applying mixture of PbI2 and PbCl2 as the lead salts here, a fast conversion rate was found and a new PbICl phase was involved."
"This work reports on incorporation of spectrally tuned gold/silica (Au/SiO2) core/shell nanospheres and nanorods into the inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSC). The band gap of hybrid lead halide iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) can be gradually increased by replacing iodide with increasing amounts of bromide, which can not only offer an appreciate solar radiation window for the surface plasmon resonance effect utilization, but also potentially result in a large open circuit voltage. The introduction of localized surface plasmons in CH3NH3PbI2.85Br0.15-based photovoltaic system, which occur in response to electromagnetic radiation, has shown dramatic enhancement of exciton dissociation. The synchronized improvement in photovoltage and photocurrent leads to an inverted CH3NH3PbI2.85Br0.15 planar PVSC device with power conversion efficiency of 13.7%. The spectral response characterization, time resolved photoluminescence, and transient photovoltage decay measurements highlight the efficient and simple method for perovskite devices."
"Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is broadly utilized for the development of disposable lab-on-a-chip systems. For many microfluidic applications hydrophilic surface characteristics are indispensable. In this work, an easy, reliable and stable surface hydrophilization procedure based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-silanization is presented that overcomes the hydrophobic nature of PDMS. "
"To deposit uniform CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) mixed halide perovskite film reproducibly, we separated the conventional process to formation of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder by heat-treatment process and deposition of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film by single step spin-coating. The deviation of power conversion efficiency of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells prepared by currently proposed method and conventional method was 13.75 ± 0.88% and 8.02 ± 1.65%, respectively, because more uniform MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film could be reproducibly formed by separating the formation process of mixed halide perovskite powder and the single step spin-coating process."
"Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL) have attracted significant attention during recent years. However, these devices suffer from a serious stability issue due to the acidic and hygroscopic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature and solution-processed CuI film which is used as the HTL for inverted perovskite solar cells. As a result, an impressive PCE of 16.8% is achieved by the device based on the CuI HTL. Moreover, the unsealed CuI-based device displays enhanced air stability compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based device. In addition, the fabrication of the CuI HTL is a simple and time-saving procedure without any post-treatment, thus making it a promising candidate as the HTL in inverted perovskite solar cells and a potential target for efficient flexible and tandem solar cells."
The paper PSCs (PPSC) were developed with a low-temperature paper Au SnO2 /meso-TiO2 /CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx / Au/MoOx architecture utilizing Au/SnO2 and MoOx /Au/MoOx stacks as electron- and hole- extracting electrodes respectively.
"Wide-bandgap perovskites are recently drawing tremendous attention in the community for high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the formamidinium (FA+) and methylammonium (MA+) based wide-bandgap mixed halide perovskites suffered from high density of traps and pin-holes, respectively. Fundamental understanding on the crystallization and film formation processes are keys to overcome those challenges but not yet clearly understood. In this study, an in-situ photoluminescence technique was used to investigate the perovskite crystallization during the thermal annealing process. It is found that the crystallization of a mixed halide perovskite with bromide (Br−) and iodine (I−) ions following the Ostward ripening crystal growth. Interestingly, it is found that the initial nucleation reaction is quickly completed in the first few seconds, however, leaving the small crystals with inhomogeneous composition. The different aggregation affinities of such inhomogeneous small crystals provoke the formation of pin-holes during the thermal annealing process. By engineering the precursor solution to control the nucleation rate, the chemical composition of the small crystals has become homogenous. Uniform pin-hole free high Br−composited wide-bandgap MA0.9Cs0.1Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite films with bandgap energy of 1.8 eV have been realized. The corresponding photovoltaic devices have achieved an encouraging device efficiency of 15.1% with superb photostability"
"In this work, an efficient and stable inverted planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) with water additive has been prepared in ambient air. Adding moderate water additive to CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution leads to growth in quality of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film, because the boiling point of water is lower than that of N, N-dimethylformamide. The annealing temperature of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film is controlled to 105 °C (slightly higher than the boiling point of water) to obtain the dense perovskite film rapidly in ambient environment with ~ 40% relative humidity. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC with water additive is 14.02%, higher than that (11.17%) of the reference device without water additive. In addition, the aqueous CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solution is transformed into the stable perovskite film through the method of rapid annealing. The stable CH3NH3PbI3−xClx·nH2O system can resist the decomposition of perovskite film and weaken iodide ion migration in PSCs, which enhance stability of the device under the atmospheric environment."
"How photoexcitations evolve in time into Coulomb-bound electron and hole pairs, called excitons, and unbound charge carriers is a key cross-cutting issue in photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies. Until now, the initial quantum dynamics following photoexcitation remains elusive in the organometal halide perovskite system. Here we reveal excitonic Rydberg states with distinct formation pathways by observing the multiple resonant internal quantum transitions using ultrafast terahertz quasi-particle transport. Nonequilibrium emergent states evolve with a complex co-existence of excitons, unbound carriers and phonons, where a delayed buildup of excitons under on- and off-resonant pumping conditions allows us to distinguish between the loss of electronic coherence and hot state cooling processes. The terahertz transport with rather long dephasing time and scattering processes due to discrete terahertz phonons in perovskites are distinct from conventional photovoltaic materials. In addition to providing implications for ultrafast coherent transport, these results break ground for a perovskite-based device paradigm for terahertz and coherent optoelectronics."
"Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention in the past few years owing to their rapid increase of the conversion efficiency and solution-processable fabrication. However, most of the highly efficient PSCs are employing low conductive organic compounds as the electron blocking material, which are still facing the issues of expensive cost and complex fabrication. Here, we present a new architecture of PSCs with gradually enlarged bandgap perovskites self-blocking the charge recombination. The perfect alignment of gradually enlarged bandgap was formed via in-situ ion-exchanging a thin layer of I− by Br− through a simply thermal evaporation method. With the perovskites self-passivation, the electron lifetime was improved 10 times in comparison with the controlled sample. Thus, we obtained a high conversion efficiency of 16.6% with short circuit current of 21.15 mA/cm2 and open circuit voltage of 1.05 V for the self-passivated PSCs."
"In this study, the electrodeposition (ED) of ultrathin, compact TiO2 blocking layers (BLs) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is evaluated. This bottom-up method allows for controlling the morphology and thickness of TiO2 films by simply manipulating deposition conditions. Compared with BLs produced using the spin-coating (SC) method, BLs produced using ED exhibit satisfactory surface coverage, even with a film thickness of 29 nm. Evidence from cyclic voltammetry shows that an ED BL suppresses interfacial recombination more profoundly than an SC BL does, consequently improving the photovoltaic properties of the PSC significantly. A PSC equipped with an ED TiO2 BL having a 13.6% power conversion efficiency is demonstrated."
"All-inorganic and lead-free cesium tin halides (CsSnX3, X=Cl, Br, I) are highly desirable for substituting the organolead halide perovskite solar cells. However, the poor stability of CsSnX3 perovskites has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. In this paper, a two-step sequential deposition method is developed to grow high-quality B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films and their unique phase change in atmosphere is explored in detail. We find the spontaneous oxidative conversion from unstable B-γ-CsSnI3 to air-stable Cs2SnI6 in air. Allowing the phase conversion of the CsSnI3 film to evolve in ambient air it gives the semiconducting perovskite Cs2SnI6 with a bandgap of 1.48 eV and high absorption coefficient (over 105 cm−1 from 1.7 eV). More importantly, the Cs2SnI6 film, for the first time, is adopted as a light absorber layer for a lead-free perovskite solar cell and a preliminary estimate of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 1% with open-circuit voltage of 0.51 V and short-circuit current of 5.41 mA/cm2 is realized by optimizing the perovskite absorber thickness. According to the bandgap and the Shockley-Queisser limit, such inorganic perovskite solar cell with higher efficiency and pronounced stability can be expected by material quality improvement and device engineering."
"Hole transporting layer (HTL) plays an important role in device stability and charge transport for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a novel HTL consisted of mesoporous NiO nanosheet (NS) was fabricated via simple hydrothermal method. The contract region of HTL/perovskite was increased by using the mesoporous NiO NS network structure, resulting in the good interface contract and rapid charge transfer. Therefore, the corresponding devices exhibit an optimal power conversion efficiency of >12%, with hysteresis-less. Besides, the developed PSCs still maintain 75% efficiency after 500 h, implying its good stability. In a word, this mesoporous NiO NS structure can be a promising candidate for HTL of inverted PSCs."
"Inorganic halide perovskite CsPbIBr2 with superior stability is regarded as a promising candidate for photovoltaic cells. However, a high-temperature annealing recipe (∼300 °C) is generally required to fulfill the crystallization of pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films. Herein, we report that precursor solution aging time strikingly affects the crystallization kinetics of CsPbIBr2 film in a one-step spin-coating method. Upon control of this subtle factor, crystallization temperature of pure-phase and full-coverage CsPbIBr2 films can be greatly lowered to 100 °C. Carbon-based all-inorganic planar cells with these CsPbIBr2 films yield a record efficiency of 6.55%, coupled with excellent long-term operational stability against moisture and heat. Our work for the first time suggests that CsPbIBr2 precursor aging time should be carefully concerned in a one-step solution method, and suggests a facile strategy to realize efficient and stable all-inorganic perovskite solar cells."
"Even though poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been commonly used as a hole extraction layer (HEL) for p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the cells’ photovoltaic performance deteriorates because of the low and unstable work functions (WFs) of PEDOT:PSS versus those of a perovskite layer. To overcome this drawback, we synthesized a copolymer (P(SS-co-TFPMA)) ionomer consisting of PSS and tetrafluoropropylmethacrylate (TFPMA) as an alternative to conventional PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) copolymer solution and its film exhibited excellent homogeneity and high phase stability compared with a physical mixture of TFPMA with PEDOT:PSS solution. During spin coating, a self-organized conducting PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) HEL evolved and the topmost PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) film showed a hydrophobic surface with a higher WF compared to that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film because of its chemically bonded electron-withdrawing fluorinated functional groups. Interestingly, the WF of the conventional PEDOT:PSS film dramatically deteriorated after being coated with a perovskite layer, whereas the PEDOT:P(SS-co-TFPMA) film represented a relatively small influence"
"Extending the spectral response from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible-light range and enhancing the UV-light stability are two remaining challenges for the development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Lanthanide complexes show a broad absorption range in the UV region and can down convert UV-light into visible-light; thus, they are potentially able to improve the device performance of PSCs. Herein, we report the fabrication of PSCs with a novel samarium (Sm)-based down conversion nanomaterial, Sr2CeO4:Sm3+ (SCOS). In comparison to the control device without a SCOS layer, the SCOS-coated device shows an enhancement of 11.4% in photocurrent and 16.2% in average power conversion efficiency (PCE), due to the harvesting and re-emitting of UV-light in the visible range through the SCOS layer. Significantly, the SCOS-coated devices retain 50% of their initial PCE for 60 hours under continuous UV-light illumination and even after 60 days of storage under ambient environment conditions, whilst for the control device the longevity is 15 hours and 26 days, respectively. The results suggest that the SCOS layer makes an important contribution in terms of both enhanced photovoltaic performance and prolonged device stability by reducing photo-loss and photo-degradation"
"A series of new branched hole transporting materials (HTMs) containing two diphenylamine-substituted carbazole fragments linked by a nonconjugated methylenebenzene unit is synthesized and tested in perovskite solar cells. Synthesis of the investigated materials is performed by a simple two-step synthetic procedure providing a target product in high yield. The isolated materials demonstrate good thermal stability and majority of the investigated compounds exist in an amorphous state, which is advantageous as there is no risk of crystallization directly in the film. The highest charge drift mobility of µ0 = 4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, measured at weak electric fields, is by ca. one order of magnitude higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD under identical conditions. From the perovskite solar cell testing results, it can be seen that performance of two new HTMs (V885 and V911) is on a par with Spiro-OMeTAD. Due to the ease of synthesis, good thermal, optical and photophysical properties, this type of molecules hold great promise for practical application in commercial perovskite solar cells."
"This study determines the effects of annealing treatment on the structure and the optical and electronic behaviors of the mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite system. The experimental results reveal that (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x (x ~ 0.2) is an effective light-absorbing material for use in inverted planar perovskite solar cells owing to its large absorbance and tunable band gap. Therefore, good band-matching between the (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x and C60 in photovoltaic devices can be controlled by annealing at various temperatures. Accordingly, an inverted mixed perovskite solar cell with a record efficiency of 12.0% under AM1.5G irradiation is realized."
"The impact of magnetic fields on the morphology of hybrid perovskite films is assessed via scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Small-grain non-uniform perovskite films are obtained when a large magnetic flux density is applied to the sample during reaction of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (chloride). Similarly, X-ray diffraction reveals a change of preferential crystalline planes when large magnetic fields are applied. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the quality of the perovskite film is affected by the magnetic field induced by the magnetic stirring system of the hot plate where the samples are annealed. As a consequence, optimization of the perovskite layer varies with magnetic field and annealing temperature. Finally, we prove that uncontrolled magnetic fields on the environment of preparation can severely influence the reproducibility of results."
"The phase instability and large energy loss are two obstacles to achieve stable and efficient inorganic-CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells. In this work, stable cubic perovskite (α)-phase CsPbI2Br is successfully achieved by Pb(Ac)2 functioning at the grain boundary under low temperature. Ac− strongly coordinates with CsPbI2Br to stabilize the α-phase and also make the grain size smaller and film uniform by fast nucleation. PbO is formed in situ at the grain boundary by decomposing Pb(Ac)2 at high-temperature annealing. The semiconducting PbO effectively passivates the surface states, reduces the interface recombination, and promotes the charge transport in CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells. A 12% efficiency and good stability are obtained for in situ PbO-passivated CsPbI2Br solar cells, while Pb(Ac)2-passivated device exhibits 8.7% performance and the highest stability, much better than the control device with 8.5% performance and inferior stability. This article highlights the extrinsic ionic grain boundary functionalization to achieve stable and efficient inorganic CsPbI3−xBrx materials and the devices"
"In this work, we utilized the electrospray technique to deposit the solidified crystal precursors on the substrate to investigate the transition processes in forming an orthorhombic methylammonium lead iodide film for fabricating perovskite planar heterojunction solar cells. The formation of solidified crystal precursors by the electrospray technique improves the de-wetting of the perovskite film on the substrate. Judicious selection of the applied voltage in the electrospray process generates crystal precursors of the appropriate dimensions. These as-electrosprayed crystals are the solid-state reactants for the halogen exchange and they form a uniformly covered film on the substrate under suitable annealing conditions. The hybrid device prepared by the electrospray technique exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 9.3%, a short-circuit current of 19.71 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.87 V, and a fill factor of 0.55. The electrospray technique with the solid-state reaction mechanism proposed in this paper would be ideal for the large-area coating of a perovskite active layer, and thus has potential for use in real mass production."
"The biggest challenge for the pursuit of potentially available perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is to achieve both high power conversion efficiency and good long-term stability. Here we report a facile CH3NH3Br (MABr) additive route to achieve the aim. We demonstrate that the application of MABr additive can greatly improve the quality of the perovskite film by diminishing the number of small crystal grains to form large ones, which can substantially decrease grain boundaries and enable direct connection of electron- and hole-transport layers with one large crystal grain. These changes lead to enhanced electron transport rate, suppressed recombination, improved photovoltaic performance, and reduced hysteresis of the device assembled using the perovskite film with MABr additive compared to the device without the MABr additive. Furthermore, the large crystal grains and their compact stacking can effectively withstand moisture corrosion, thereby contributing to significantly enhanced air stability for the perovskite film with MABr additive and the corresponding device. This work highlights the valuable MABr additive route for developing potentially available, efficient, and stable PSCs."
"Solution-processed polycrystalline perovskite films contribute critically to the high photovoltaic performance of perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs). The inevitable electronic trap states at grain boundaries and intrinsic defects such as metallic lead (Pb0) and halide vacancies in perovskite films cause serious carrier recombination loss. Furthermore, the film can easily decompose into PbI2 in a moist atmosphere. Here, we introduce a simple strategy, through a small increase in methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI), molar proportion (5%), for perovskite fabrication in ambient air with ∼50% relative humidity. Analysis of the morphology and crystallography demonstrates that excess MAI significantly promotes grain growth without decomposition. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows that no metallic Pb0 exists in the perovskite film and the I/Pb ratio is improved. A time-resolved photoluminescence measurement indicates efficient suppression of non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer. As a result, the device yields improved power conversion efficiency from 14.06% to 18.26% with reduced hysteresis and higher stability under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). This work strongly provides a feasible and low-cost way to develop highly efficient PSCs in ambient air."
"Here, we report a rapid and simple process to prepare perovskite solar cells in ambient air by adding 2-pyridylthiourea in the precursor solution. 2-Pyridylthiourea can not only promote the conversion of 2-D PbI2 to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, but also improve the quality of the perovskite absorber layer via enhancing the uniformity and the size of the crystal grains. The perovskite solar cells with the addition of 2-pyridylthiourea at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 exhibited a remarkable overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2%, which is among the highest PCE of CH3NH3PbI3-based devices fabricated in ambient air. It also showed an 18% increase and less hysteresis compared with the cells without additives. Importantly, the devices with 2-pyridylthiourea show relatively better stability compared to reference devices when aged under ambient air of 55 ± 5% relative humidity in the dark and under 65 °C after 30 days. The presented results clearly show that 2-pyridylthiourea can be an additive candidate for tuning the morphology of perovskite thin films, which may be a new direction for large-scale production of PSCs."
"The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and rGO-g-poly(3-dodecyl thiophene) (PDDT) precursors were applied in the active layers of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. The rGO-g-PDDT modified perovskite devices represented the lower charge-transfer resistance (31.8 Ω cm2), higher short circuit current density (20.86 mA/cm2) and thus the larger performance (14.07%) compared with the pristine (74.2 Ω cm2, 17.90 mA/cm2, 11.10%) and rGO-incorporated devices (82.4 Ω cm2, 13.65 mA/cm2, 8.00%). The grafted-rGO components improved the cell characteristics, whereas the bared rGO nanostructures ruined them. The narrow distribution and thereby the high reproducibility and high performance in perovskite + rGO-g-PDDT photovoltaics were attributed to the improved morphology and enhanced grain size (190 nm vs 400 nm), progressed optical absorbance, and enhanced crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites through the incorporation of rGO-g-PDDT modifiers."
"In this paper, we develop the hybrid perovskite-based n-i-p solar cell using a simple, fast and low-cost dip-coating method. Hot solution and the pre-annealed substrate are used for coating the perovskite thin film by this method this is further used for studying its structural and electrical properties. UV–vis spectroscopy is carried out for calculating the band gap of the hybrid perovskite layer which is ∼1.6 eV. X-ray spectroscopy confirms that the formation of hybrid perovskite layer. The profilometer is used to study the surface roughness and also for measuring the thickness of the perovskite layer with varying substrate temperature. The optimized sample was further used for cross-sectional SEM image to verify the thickness measured from the profiler. The electrical parameter of JV characteristic with varying temperature is tabulated in the table. Whereas, the perovskite sensitized solar cell exhibits highest short circuit current density, Jsc of 11 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage, Voc of 0.87 V, fill factor of 0.55 and efficiency, η of >5%."
"In spite of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs has been rapidly improved, many changes, such as defects, poor morphology and expensive hole transporte materials (HTM), are still on the way to commercial application. In this paper, CuSCN was used as the HTM to substitute the popular Spiro-OMeTAD, because of its high hole transfer capability and much lower cost. A simple, planar construction device of FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/CuSCN/Au has been prepared, yielding a best PCE of 10.41%. To improve the stability and performance of the device, 1 mol % CuSCN was innovatively introduced into the absorber layer. The grain size of the MAPbI3 layer has increased obviously and the defects in the device were also reduced. The fast charge transportation and extraction make the short-circuit currents increased from 18.39 mA/cm2 to 22.18 mA/cm2. The PCE of the CuSCN doped perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased 21.4% compared to the control device without added. In the meantime, the hysteresis and stability have also been improved effectively. The PCE of the CuSCN doped MAPbI3 device only dropped 28% from the initial efficiency after 500 h stored in an ambient air with temperature of 25°Cand humidity of 20%, whereas the device without CuSCN doped droped 48%. This result indicates that CuSCN has great potential as a doping to improve the morphology of perovskite films and enhance the performance of the PSCs"
"Despite tremendous progress in efficiency and stability, perovskite solar cells are still facing the challenge of upscaling. Here we present unique advantages of reactive polyiodide melts for solvent- and adduct-free reactionary fabrication of perovskite films exhibiting excellent quality over large areas. Our method employs a nanoscale layer of metallic Pb coated with stoichiometric amounts of CH3NH3I (MAI) or mixed CsI/MAI/NH2CHNH2I (FAI), subsequently exposed to iodine vapour. The instantly formed MAI3(L) or Cs(MA,FA)I3(L) polyiodide liquid converts the Pb layer into a pure perovskite film without byproducts or unreacted components at nearly room temperature. We demonstrate highly uniform and relatively large area MAPbI3 perovskite films, such as 100 cm2 on glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and 600 cm2 on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate solar cells with reverse scan power conversion efficiencies of 16.12% (planar MAPbI3), 17.18% (mesoscopic MAPbI3) and 16.89% (planar Cs0.05MA0.2FA0.75PbI3) in the standard FTO/c(m)-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture."
"As the long-term stability and toxicity of Pb are two profound concerns for the commercialization of Pb-based perovskite solar cells, we have undertaken this study to understand the performance degradation of perovskite solar cells at high temperature (60, 80, 100 and 120 °C) and under a humid (30–50% relative humidity) environment, and then tried to reuse the perovskite films from the degraded cells to recover the cell efficiency so as to avoid dumping of Pb-waste into the environment. As found in this study, the performance of MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) cells using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM) deteriorated mainly not due to the degradation of the perovskite but because of the modification of the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD at high temperature. In addition, the spiro-OMeTAD layer underwent a severe morphological deformation at high temperature, showing large voids in it, which reduced the cell performance further. However, despite the complete reconversion of PbI2 to perovskite and the replacement of the degraded spiro-OMeTAD film with a fresh layer in the MAPbI3 cells, the cell performance was not recovered to the initial value because the modified perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface became worse after recycling. The thermal stability and performance recovery upon recycling were found to depend on the composition of the perovskite; faster degradation of MAPbI3 cells with a slight excess of MAI and better stability of cells not containing MA (FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3, FA = CH(NH2)2) indicated certain involvement of MA+ ions in the alteration of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Unlike the heat-treatment case, MAPbI3 cells, when exposed to a humid environment, degraded significantly to PbI2 and the reconversion of this PbI2 to perovskite followed by deposition of a fresh spiro-OMeTAD layer increased the cell performance but it did not recover to the initial value. This poor recovery in these cells was due to inefficient carrier transport that resulted in a lower photocurrent in the recycled devices."
"A variety of dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is developed to serve as alternatives to the typical dopant-treated ones; however, their photovoltaic performance still falls far behind. In this work, the side chain of a polymeric HTM is engineered by partially introducing diethylene glycol (DEG) groups in order to simultaneously optimize the properties of both the bulk of the HTM layer and the HTM/perovskite interface. The intermolecular π–π stacking interaction in the HTM layer is unexpectedly weakened after the incorporation of DEG groups, whereas the lamellar packing interaction is strengthened. A doubled hole mobility is obtained when 3% of the DEG groups replace the original alkyl side chains, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.19% (certified: 20.10%) is then achieved, which is the first report of values over 20% for dopant-free organic HTMs. The device maintains 92.25% of its initial PCE after storing at ambient atmosphere for 30 d, which should be due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the HTM film."
"In this work, the design and synthesis of a thiophene-core based hole transporting material (D1) are presented. It is shown that PSCs with D1 reach a power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 16.5%,which is lower than 19.8% obtained by spiro-OMeTAD-based device. Importantly, the devices based-on D1 show relatively better stability compared to devices based on spiro-OMeTAD when aged under ambient air and under continuous 1-sun illumination in nitrogen, respectively. Moreover, the cost of D1 is around 1/30 of that of spiro-OMeTAD.The present finding highlights the potential of thiophene core or makes D1 as a potential HTM core for low-cost and high-performance PSCs."
"High-performance planar heterojunction perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cell (PVSC) is demonstrated by utilizing CuSCN as a hole-transporting layer. Efficient hole-transport and hole-extraction at the CuSCN/CH3NH3PbI3 interface facilitate the PVSCs to reach 16% power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, excellent transparency of CuSCN enables high-performance semitransparent PVSC (10% PCE and 25% average visible transmittance) to be realized. "
"Hybrid organometal halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) are a promising class of cost- and energy-efficient light absorption materials for thin-film photovoltaics. In this work, the preparation and characterization of MAPbI3 nanoparticles (NPs) on TiOx/indium tin oxide glass substrates using a simple spin-coating technique have been investigated. The NPs were prepared by spin-coating solutions of MAPbI3 and the ionic liquid (IL) 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride in N,N-dimethylformamide. Analysis of the resulting spin-coated films revealed that uniform spherical MAPbI3 NPs with an average diameter of 540 nm were homogeneously distributed on the TiOx substrates. MAPbI3 films with similar crystallinity were observed irrespective of the inclusion of IL, as evident from the X-ray diffraction patterns of the films. However, addition of IL to the spin-coating solution facilitated the formation of homogenous nucleation sites and prevented rapid crystal formation of MAPbI3. Therefore, the presence of an IL resulted in uniform thin films with good morphology."
"Doping properties of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) hole transport layer are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy under air exposure. XPS results reveal that 3 h exposure of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) doped spiro-MeOTAD to air results in the migration of LiTFSI from the bottom to the top across the spiro-MeOTAD film. AFM images reveal the presence of pinholes with an average diameter of ∼135 nm and a density of ∼3.72 holes/μm2. In addition, cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images reveal that these pinholes form channels across the doped spiro-MeOTAD film. Optical microscopy and Fourier transform infrared microscopy images confirm the presence of large pinholes with diameters in the range of 1–20 μm and a density of ∼289 holes/mm2 as well. The presence of pinholes may play a major role in the migration processes of the LiTFSI within the spiro-MeOTAD film as well as on the degradation processes of solar cells. This is further confirmed by the rapid decreasing efficiency of perovskite solar cells with solution prepared doped spiro-MeOTAD layers when exposed to air."
"Although the solar cells based on the α-CsPbI3 presents very impressive power conversion efficiency, it suffers from insufficient crystalline structure stability even in ambient condition. Herein, the black orthorhombic γ phase based CsPbI3 is successfully fabricated with its performance further optimized by doping chlorine ions. It is found that the chlorine incorporation improves crystallization dynamics for favorable surface morphology and crystalline orientation. In particular by doping 3 mol% chlorine into the γ-CsPbI3 film, its trap density is minimized with enhanced black phase stability and much improved thin film characteristics, including conductivities, electron and hole mobilities. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is increased to as high as 16.07%. More importantly, the PCE of the optimized device shows only 0.45% degradation after continuous light soaking for 200 h. It retains as much as 94% of its initial PCE even after being exposed in air (relative humidity of 20–30% at 25 °C) for 60 days."
"The inorganic–organic perovskite is currently attracting a lot of attention due to its use as a light harvester in solar cells. The large absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility and good stability of organo-lead halide perovskites present good potential for their use as light harvesters in mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells. This work concentrated on a unique property of the lead halide perovskite, its function simultaneously as a light harvester and a hole conductor in the solar cell. A two-step deposition technique was used to optimize the perovskite deposition and to enhance the solar cell efficiency. It was revealed that the photovoltaic performance of the hole conductor free perovskite solar cell is strongly dependent on the depletion layer width which was created at the TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 junction. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that there were no changes in the crystallographic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite over time, which supports the high stability of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the best cells reached 10.85% with a fill factor of 68%, a Voc of 0.84 V, and a Jsc of 19 mA cm−2, the highest efficiency to date of a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell."
"We developed a new donor–π–acceptor-type hole-transport material (HTMs) incorporating S,N-heteropentacene as π-spacer, triarylamine as donor, and dicyanovinylene as acceptor. In addition to appropriate frontier molecular orbital energies, the new HTM showed high photo absorptivity in the visible region. Without the use of p-dopants, solution-processed mixed perovskite devices using the HTM achieved power conversion efficiencies of up to 16.9% and high photocurrents of up to 22.2 mA cm−2. These results demonstrate that heteroacene can be an excellent building block to prepare alternative HTMs for perovskite solar cells and hold promise for further advancement through fine-tuning the molecular structure."
"CH3NH3PbI3 planar-structure perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the configuration FTO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/Au. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by the precipitation method. Three different deposition methods including spin-coating, spraying and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) were applied to fabricate the ZnO films as electron transport layers. Certain analyses, such as XRD, SEM, FESEM, UV-visible and I–V measurements, were carried out to evaluate the performance of the cells. The best cell performance was achieved for the perovskite solar cell with a ZnO film coated by the spin method. The average efficiency was 7% without using any hole transport materials and 10.25% using spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport material. The average efficiencies of the cells coated by the spraying and SILAR methods using spiro-OMeTAD, were found to be 8.64% and 7.7% respectively. This study demonstrates the versatility of the spray and SILAR coating methods and their potential for fabricating low-cost, large scale, flexible and mass produced perovskite solar cells."
"Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties.First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks.Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the networks prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input."
"We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: Our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes."
"In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fréchet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape."
"Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work has assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from a cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived through the camera."
"In this paper, we propose the ""adversarial autoencoder"" (AAE), which is a probabilistic autoencoder that uses the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform variational inference by matching the aggregated posterior of the hidden code vector of the autoencoder with an arbitrary prior distribution. Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks. "
"Graph neural networks (GNN) have been shown to provide substantial performance improvements for atomistic material representation and modeling compared with descriptor-based machine learning models. While most existing GNN models for atomistic predictions are based on atomic distance information, they do not explicitly incorporate bond angles, which are critical for distinguishing many atomic structures. Furthermore, many material properties are known to be sensitive to slight changes in bond angles. We present an Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN), a GNN architecture that performs message passing on both the interatomic bond graph and its line graph corresponding to bond angles. We demonstrate that angle information can be explicitly and efficiently included, leading to improved performance on multiple atomistic prediction tasks. We ALIGNN models for predicting 52 solid-state and molecular properties available in the JARVIS-DFT, Materials project, and QM9 databases. ALIGNN can outperform some previously reported GNN models on atomistic prediction tasks with better or comparable model training speed."
" This paper introduces a new model to learn graph neural networks equivariant to rotations, translations, reflections and permutations called E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs). In contrast with existing methods, our work does not require computationally expensive higher-order representations in intermediate layers while it still achieves competitive or better performance. In addition, whereas existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on dynamical systems modelling, representation learning in graph autoencoders and predicting molecular properties. "
"Group equivariant neural networks have been explored in the past few years and are interesting from theoretical and practical standpoints. They leverage concepts from group representation theory, non-commutative harmonic analysis and differential geometry that do not often appear in machine learning. In practice, they have been shown to reduce sample and model complexity, notably in challenging tasks where input transformations such as arbitrary rotations are present. We begin this work with an exposition of group representation theory and the machinery necessary to define and evaluate integrals and convolutions on groups. Then, we show applications to recent SO(3) and SE(3) equivariant networks, namely the Spherical CNNs, Clebsch-Gordan Networks, and 3D Steerable CNNs. We proceed to discuss two recent theoretical results. "
" We survey the mathematical foundations of geometric deep learning, focusing on group equivariant and gauge equivariant neural networks. We develop gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks on arbitrary manifolds M using principal bundles with structure group K and equivariant maps between sections of associated vector bundles. We also discuss group equivariant neural networks for homogeneous spaces M=G/K, which are instead equivariant with respect to the global symmetry G on M. Group equivariant layers can be interpreted as intertwiners between induced representations of G, and we show their relation to gauge equivariant convolutional layers. We analyze several applications of this formalism, including semantic segmentation and object detection networks. We also discuss the case of spherical networks in great detail, corresponding to the case M=S2=SO(3)/SO(2). Here we emphasize the use of Fourier analysis involving Wigner matrices, spherical harmonics and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for G=SO(3), illustrating the power of representation theory for deep learning.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNN) come in many flavors, but should always be either invariant (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the output) or \emph{equivariant} (permutation of the input permutes the output). In this paper, we consider a specific class of invariant and equivariant networks, for which we prove new universality theorems. More precisely, we consider networks with a single hidden layer, obtained by summing channels formed by applying an equivariant linear operator, a pointwise non-linearity, and either an invariant or equivariant linear output layer. Recently, Maron et al. (2019) showed that by allowing higher-order tensorization inside the network, universal invariant GNNs can be obtained. As a first contribution, we propose an alternative proof of this result, which relies on the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of real-valued functions. Our main contribution is then an extension of this result to the \emph{equivariant} case, which appears in many practical applications but has been less studied from a theoretical point of view. The proof relies on a new generalized Stone-Weierstrass theorem for algebra of equivariant functions, which is of independent interest. Additionally, unlike many previous works that consider a fixed number of nodes, our results show that a GNN defined by a single set of parameters can approximate uniformly well a function defined on graphs of varying size."

It is concluded that a paradigm shift is required in order to fully exploit AM potential."
"The latest industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is encouraging the integration of intelligent production systems and advanced information technologies. Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered to be an essential ingredient in this new movement. In this paper, a comprehensive review on AM technologies is presented together with both its contributions to Industry 4.0. The review focusses on three important aspects of AM: recent advances on material science, process development, and enhancements on design consideration. The main objective of the paper is to classify the current knowledge (and technological trends) on AM and to highlight its potential uses."
"Stretchable electronics are mechanically compatible with a variety of objects, especially with the soft curvilinear contours of the human body, enabling human-friendly electronics applications that could not be achieved with conventional rigid electronics. Therefore, extensive research effort has been devoted to the development of stretchable electronics, from research on materials and unit device, to fully integrated systems. In particular, material-processing technologies that encompass the synthesis, assembly, and patterning of intrinsically stretchable electronic materials have been actively investigated and have provided many notable breakthroughs for the advancement of stretchable electronics. Here, the latest studies of such material-based approaches are reviewed, mainly focusing on intrinsically stretchable electronic nanocomposites that generally consist of conducting/semiconducting filler materials inside or on elastomer backbone matrices. Various approaches for fabricating these intrinsically stretchable electronic materials are presented, including the blending of electronic fillers into elastomer matrices, the formation of bi-layered heterogeneous electronic-layer and elastomer support-layer structures, and modifications to polymeric molecular structures in order to impart stretchability. Detailed descriptions of the various conducting/semiconducting composites prepared by each method are provided, along with their electrical/mechanical properties and examples of device applications. To conclude, a brief future outlook is presented."
The purpose of this paper is to present a mask‐image‐projection‐based stereolithography (MIP‐SL) process that can combine two base materials with various concentrations and structures to produce a solid object with desired material characteristics. Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process in which liquid photopolymer resin is cross‐linked and converted to solid. The fabrication of digital material requires frequent resin changes during the building process. The process presented in this paper attempts to address the related challenges in achieving such fabrication capability.
"We present a design rationale for stretchable soft network composites for engineering tissues that predominantly function under high tensile loads. The convergence of 3D-printed fibers selected from a design library and biodegradable interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) result in biomimetic tissue engineered constructs (bTECs) with fully tunable properties that can match specific tissue requirements. We present our technology platform using an exemplary soft network composite model that is characterized to be flexible, yet ∼125 times stronger (E = 3.19 MPa) and ∼100 times tougher (WExt = ∼2000 kJ m–3) than its hydrogel counterpart."
"Fiber-based structures are highly desirable for wearable electronics that are expected to be light-weight, long-lasting, flexible, and conformable. Many fibrous structures have been manufactured by well-established lost-effective textile processing technologies, normally at ambient conditions. The advancement of nanotechnology has made it feasible to build electronic devices directly on the surface or inside of single fibers, which have typical thickness of several to tens microns. However, imparting electronic functions to porous, highly deformable and three-dimensional fiber assemblies and maintaining them during wear represent great challenges from both views of fundamental understanding and practical implementation. This article attempts to critically review the current state-of-arts with respect to materials, fabrication techniques, and structural design of devices as well as applications of the fiber-based wearable electronic products. In addition, this review elaborates the performance requirements of the fiber-based wearable electronic products, especially regarding the correlation among materials, fiber/textile structures and electronic as well as mechanical functionalities of fiber-based electronic devices. Finally, discussions will be presented regarding to limitations of current materials, fabrication techniques, devices concerning manufacturability and performance as well as scientific understanding that must be improved prior to their wide adoption."
"With compact footprint, low energy consumption, high scalability, and mass producibility, chip-scale integrated devices are an indispensable part of modern technological change and development. Recent advances in 2D layered materials with their unique structures and distinctive properties have motivated their on-chip integration, yielding a variety of functional devices with superior performance and new features. To realize integrated devices incorporating 2D materials, it requires a diverse range of device fabrication techniques, which are of fundamental importance to achieve good performance and high reproducibility.

"Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a kind of nontoxic high-performance thermoplastic widely used for medical applications. Compared with other special engineering plastics, PEEK has many excellent properties, such as high temperature resistance, chemical corrosion resistance, radiation resistance, hydrolysis resistance, excellent mechanical properties, good self-lubrication and easy processing. Although PEEK has been widely used as the replacements of metallic and ceramic implants in medical field, it is biologically inertia, which reduces the fusion with host bone tissue after implantation. In addition, the high friction coefficient and hydrophobicity of PEEK also seriously hinder its applications. In view of these, the studies of PEEK biomaterials have now focused on the improvement of biological activity by various material engineering strategies. In this paper, these recently developed strategies to improve PEEK bioactivity to address clinical orthopedic needs (e.g., anti-inflammation, anti-infection and osteointegration) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are further analyzed. This review paper may provide more targeted direction for developing multifunctional PEEK-based implants in the future."
"Heating plays a vital role in science, engineering, mining, and space, where heating can be achieved via electrical, induction, infrared, or microwave radiation. For fast switching and continuous applications, hotplate or Peltier elements can be employed. However, due to bulkiness, they are ineffective for portable applications or operation at remote locations. Miniaturization of heaters reduces power consumption and bulkiness, enhances the thermal response, and integrates with several sensors or microfluidic chips. The microheater has a thickness of ~ 100 nm to ~ 100 μm and offers a temperature range up to 1900℃ with precise control. In recent years, due to the escalating demand for flexible electronics, thin-film microheaters have emerged as an imperative research area. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in microheater as well as analyses different microheater designs, materials, fabrication, and temperature control. In addition, the applications of microheaters in gas sensing, biological, and electrical and mechanical sectors are emphasized. Moreover, the maximum temperature, voltage, power consumption, response time, and heating rate of each microheater are tabulated. Finally, we addressed the specific key considerations for designing and fabricating a microheater as well as the importance of microheater integration in COVID-19 diagnostic kits. This review thereby provides general guidelines to researchers to integrate microheater in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), which may pave the way for developing rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits in resource-constrained clinical or home-based environments."
"Particulate matter (PM) poses a severe health threat to the public, and fibrous filtration is a powerful method for efficient PM removal. Arming the fibers with electrostatic effect is a gold rush to promote PM-fiber interaction, thus reaching high PM removal efficiency, decreasing airflow resistance, and achieving multifunctional applications simultaneously. In this study, we are to provide a comprehensive overview of electrostatic fibrous filters, including the principles, fabrication process, electrical properties, and applications. Firstly, PM-fiber adhesion forces during the filtration were analyzed according to the electrified principle for the filters. Furthermore, electrostatic filters were classified into monopolar-charged and dipolar-induced filters in the dimension of charging characteristics. Compared with other PM removal techniques, the electrical properties, comprehensive performance, and applications for various electrostatic filters are systematically stated and discussed. In the end, we highlighted that the electrostatic fibrous filters would be a competitive candidate for PM removal owing to their durability, versatility, and plasticity. We also discussed the importance of conducting rigorous filtration tests to report accurate performance for electrostatic filters. In an interdisciplinary view between environmental engineering and material engineering, we hope this work could provide a better understanding of the PM-fiber electrostatic interactions and practical insights for designing next-generation air filters."
"Overlaying two atomic layers with a slight lattice mismatch or at a small rotation angle creates a moiré superlattice, which has properties that are markedly modified from (and at times entirely absent in) the ‘parent’ materials. Such moiré materials have progressed the study and engineering of strongly correlated phenomena and topological systems in reduced dimensions. The fundamental understanding of the electronic phases, such as superconductivity, requires a precise control of the challenging fabrication process, involving the rotational alignment of two atomically thin layers with an angular precision below 0.1 degrees. Here we review the essential properties of moiré materials and discuss their fabrication and physics from a reproducibility perspective."
"PEDOT:PSS is widely used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the most popular hole transporting layer (HTL). However, p-i-n type inverted planar PSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL typically exhibit up to 200 mV more voltage loss compared to conventional planar PSCs (n-i-p) that generally show open circuit voltages (VOC) of around 1.1 V. In this study, we develop a simple, inexpensive and effective interfacial engineering strategy by doping PEDOT:PSS with cesium iodide (CsI) to reduce the voltage loss and achieve highly efficient inverted PSCs. SEM, AFM, and XPS measurements suggest that CsI modifies the interface between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite by reacting with PbI2 to form CsPbI3, thus facilitating interfacial contact and charge transport. Moreover, after CsI-modification (CsI-PEDOT:PSS), the hole transport properties of PEDOT:PSS and the hole extraction are enhanced, while the energy levels are more favorable and charge recombination is suppressed. Importantly, compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS that suffers from a large non-radiative recombination loss (0.375 V), CsI-PEDOT:PSS makes the device to realize an impressively low non-radiative voltage loss (only 0.287 V). As a result, inverted PSCs based on CsI-PEDOT:PSS show a small voltage loss, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.22%, and no hysteresis and achieve a high VOC (1.084 V), while the control device without CsI shows an inferior efficiency of 16.57%. Both the high VOC and PCE are an improvement over literature data on modified PEDOT:PSS-based inverted PSCs."
"A flexible, saddle-like, π-conjugated skeleton composed of four fused thiophene rings forming a cyclooctatetrathiophene (CoTh) with four triphenylamines (CoTh-TTPA) is presented as a hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells. The new HTM shows a bright red color stemming from a direct conjugation between the TPA groups and the central CoTh scaffold. This results in a charge transfer band due to the combination of the weak acceptor moiety, the CoTh unit, and the electron-donating p-methoxytriphenylamine groups. CoTh-TTPA exhibits a suitable highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level in relation to the valence band edge of the perovskite, which ensures efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. It has been applied as the HTM in combination with a mixed perovskite ([FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15) and a state-of-the-art triple cation perovskite ([(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08) reaching noticeable light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of 16.3 and 15.9%, respectively. These values are slightly lower than those measured for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The HTM properties have been analyzed by means of photoluminescence and conductivity experiments, which demonstrated a better hole extraction and conductivity for spiro-OMeTAD."
"Two-dimensionally expanded π-systems, consisting of partially oxygen-bridged triarylamine skeletons that are connected to an azulene (1–3) or biphenyl core (4), were synthesized and characterized. When tetra-substituted azulene 1 was used as a hole-transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells, the observed performance (power conversion efficiency = 16.5%) was found to be superior to that of the current HTM standard Spiro-OMeTAD. A comparison of the hole mobility, the ability to control the HOMO and LUMO levels, and the hole-collection efficiency at the perovskite/HTM interface in 1 with reference compounds (2–4 and Spiro-OMeTAD) led to the elucidation of key factors required for HTMs to act efficiently in perovskite solar cells."
"Computational, thin-film deposition, and characterization approaches have been used to investigate the all-inorganic lead-free CsBi3I10 as a candidate to act as a thin-film photovoltaic absorber. In this paper, CsBi3I10 was firstly predicted with a layer crystal structure of stable hexagonal phase-like Cs3Bi2I9 and then prepared by one-step coating also showing the high purity hexagonal phase and crystallinity, very consistent with the theoretical calculation. After solvent annealing, a high absorption coefficient of approximately 105 cm–1 in visible light and a suitable optical band gap of 1.78 eV were obtained for the CsBi3I10 thin film. The solar cell based on the CsBi3I10 perovskite thin film exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 1.05%, good reproducibility, hysteresis-free behavior, and long-term stability. These results indicate that the performance of all-inorganic Pb-free perovskite solar cells can be further improved."
"Expensive and energy-consuming vacuum process of metal deposition with ambient-unstable hole transporters are incompatible with large-scale and low-cost production of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and thus hampers their commercialization. For the first time, we demonstrate cost-effective novel carbon nanotube (CNT) paste that was applied to FTO substrate by the facile doctor blade method and processed at low temperature (100 °C). Herein we report a new method of cost-efficient perovskite solar cells with the use of conventional hole transporters by directly clamping a selective hole extraction electrode made of CNT and a TiO2/perovskite photoanode. Most importantly, under optimized conditions in the absence of an organic hole-transporting material and metal contact, CH3NH3PbI3 and CNTs formed a solar cell with an efficiency of up to 7.83%. The PSC devices are fabricated in air without high-vacuum deposition which simplifies the processing and lowers the threshold of both scientific research and industrial production of PSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates good charge transport characteristics of CEs on the photovoltaic performance of devices. The PSCs exhibited good stability over 50 h. The abundance, low cost, and excellent properties of the CNT material offer wide prospects for further applications in PSCs."
"Reduced-dimensional hybrid perovskite semiconductors have recently attracted significant attention due to their promising stability and optoelectronic properties. However, the issue of poor charge transport in 2D perovskites limits its application. Here, studies on intermediate-controlled crystal growth are reported to improve charge carrier transport in 2D perovskite thin films. It is shown that the coordination strength of solvents with perovskite precursor affects the initial state of intermediate phase formation as well as the subsequent perovskite layer growth. Tuning the solvent composition with a mixture (5:5) of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) leads to the growth of highly orientated 2D perovskite films with much-improved optoelectronic properties (faster transport by ≈50x, longer carrier lifetime by ≈4x, and lower defect density by ≈30x) than the film prepared with pure DMF. Consequently, perovskite solar cells based on DMF/DMSO (5:5) show >80% efficiency improvement than the devices based on pure DMF."
"The organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells based on ternary oxide SrTiO3 shows a higher Voc, attributed to its slightly higher conduction band edge and better morphology of absorber material. However, its less efficient carrier collection and limited overall interfacial areas between the absorber material and the electron-transport layer (ETL), dramatically reducing the Jsc. Here, By adjusting the concentrations of the Ti(OBu)4, we successfully prepared the three-dimensional (3D) self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorod/SrTiO3 nanocomposites, and slightly tuned the particle size of SrTiO3. With the incorporation of the three-dimensional (3D) self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorod, the Jsc of the device based on SrTiO3 was highly boosted. The best performing solar cell we obtained exhibited a PCE of 9.99% with a Jsc of 19.48 mA/cm2. The excellent performance could be ascribed to the improvement of charge carrier collection of SrTiO3, better surface coverage and crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3, and enhanced light scattering ability caused by 3D self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorods."
"Herein, commercially accessible SnO2 and home-made TiO2 nanoparticles as a combined electron transporting bilayer (ETBL) are applied to achieve highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). With the formed cascade-aligned energy levels from the proper stacking of SnO2 and TiO2 layers and the excellent defect-passivation ability of TiO2, SnO2/TiO2 ETBLs effectively reduce energy loss and inhibit defects formation both at the electron transporting layers (ETL)/perovskite interfaces and within the bulk of perovskite layer as revealed by a comprehensive analysis of photoelectric characteristic analysis, including ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Consequently, the PSC devices acquired a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.50% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 24.2 mA cm−2 and an fill factor of 77%, which are superior to the values of the control device based on single SnO2 layer with a PCE of 18.09% (a 13.3% boosting on PCE). Moreover, there was no degradation after 49 days, indicating the great stability after adding TiO2 layer. Herein, it is demonstrated that the cascaded alignment of energy levels between the electrode and perovskite layer by ETBLs could be an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with excellent long-term stability."
"In this study, polyethylene oxide (PEO) is introduced into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite to replace the standard anti-solvent washing process of perovskite solar cells. By forming PEO-MAPbI3 composites, we achieved controllability of the perovskite surface morphology. Furthermore, the PEO addition improved the electronic properties of the composites by suppressing the trap density of the MAPbI3 perovskite. We observed a significant increase in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) from 0.24% to 7.25% using the proper PEO-perovskite composition ratio (1.5:1), based on their fabrication without any organic anti-solvent treatment. Moreover, the performance uniformity and outdoor stability were significantly enhanced by employing the composite. The proposed PEO-perovskite composite offers a promising pathway for the industrialization of PVSCs in terms of PCE, uniformity, stability, and feasibility—without involving current anti-solvent washing process"
"Lead halide perovskite solar cells afford high power conversion efficiencies, even though the photoactive layer is formed in a solution process. At the same time, solution processing may impose some severe dewetting issues, especially if organic, hydrophobic charge transport layers are considered. Ultimately, very narrow processing windows with a relatively large spread in device performance and a considerable lab-to-lab variation result. Here, we unambiguously identify dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which is commonly used as a co-solvent and complexing agent, to be the main reason for dewetting of the precursor solution on hydrophobic hole transport layers, such as polytriarylamine, in a gas-quenching-assisted deposition process. In striking contrast, we will show that N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon (NMP), which has a lower hydrophilic–lipophilic-balance, can be favorably used instead of DMSO to strongly mitigate these dewetting issues. The resulting high-quality perovskite layers are extremely tolerant with respect to the mixing ratio (NMP/dimethylformamide) and other process parameters. Thus, our findings afford an outstandingly robust, easy to use, and fail-safe deposition technique, yielding single (MAPbI3) and double (FA0.94Cs0.06PbI3) cation perovskite solar cells with high efficiencies (∼18.5%). Most notably, the statistical variation of the devices is significantly reduced, even if the deposition process is performed by different persons. We foresee that our results will further the reliable preparation of perovskite thin films and mitigate process-to-process variations that still hinder the prospects of upscaling perovskite solar technology."
"The toxicity and the instability of lead-based perovskites might eventually hamper the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Here, we present the optoelectronic properties and stability of a two-dimensional layered (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4 perovskite. This material has a low Eg of 1.81 eV and high absorption coefficient of ∼1 × 105 cm–1 at the most intensive absorption at 539 nm, implying that it is suitable for light-harvesting in thin film solar cells, especially in tandem solar cells. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirm the high stability toward humidity, heat, and ultraviolet light. Initial studies produce a mesoscopic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 0.2%. Our work may offer some useful inspiration for the further investigation of environment-friendly and stable organic–inorganic perovskite photovoltaic materials."
"Despite their excellent power conversion efficiency, MAPbI3 solar cells exhibit strong hysteresis that hinders reliable device operation. Herein it is shown that ionic motion is the dominant mechanism underlying hysteresis of MAPbI3 solar cells by studying the effects of electrical poling in different temperature ranges. Complete suppression of the hysteresis below 170 K is consistent with temperature activated diffusion of I− anions and/or the motion of the MA+ cations. Ionic motion has important effect on the overall efficiency of the MAPbI3 solar cells: the initial decrease of the power conversion efficiency while lowering the operating temperature is recovered and even enhanced up to 20% of its original value by applying an electrical poling. The open circuit voltage significantly increases and the current density fully recovers due to the reduction of the electron extraction barrier at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface driven by the charge accumulation at the interface. Moreover, beside TiO2/MAPbI3 interfacial charge transfer, charge transport in TiO2 strongly affects the photovoltaic performance, as revealed by MAPbI3/ms-TiO2 field effect transistors. These results establish the basis to develop effective strategies to mitigate operational instability of perovskites solar cells."
"Recently, Pb-based organometal halide perovskite solar cells have passed 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the main issue hampering commercialization is toxic Pb contained in these cells. Therefore, great attention is devoted to replace Pb by less harmful metals such as Bi. Yet, the most efficient methylammonium bismuth iodide (MBI) perovskite solar cells reported in literature reach PCE up to 0.2%. In this work, MBI perovskite solar cells, which are processed by spin-coating under inert nitrogen atmosphere, employing a standard non-inverted stack are presented. The control of perovskite morphology by modifying the process has been highlighted and the impact on photovoltaic (PV) characteristics has been shown. It is observed that the concentration of the perovskite solution (0.15–0.30 M) has a huge impact on the crystallite size, and the rotation speed during the spin-coating process determines the layer coverage. Exposure of MBI solar cells to ambient air is found to be essential to obtain the highest short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage. The PCE increases over time, from 0.004% directly after processing up to 0.17% after 48 h. The fabricated cells exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V, which is the highest value published for this type of solar cell."
"Here we investigate temperature-dependent charge transport in solution-processed methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite thin films with steady-state mobility measurements. Based on control of the thickness (L) of the MAPbI3 films, one attains tunability in the carrier mobility, trap density and recombination that lead to alterations in the device characteristics. We find that the increased hole mobility in MAPbI3 with incremental variations in L is associated with reduction in the trap concentration and Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. By interrogating the ideality factor, we identify that the SRH charge recombination is present in the optimal solar cell. Of interest, the impact of traps on recombination becomes weakened and eventually is overwhelmed by bimolecular recombination with increasing L. Photoluminescence decay kinetics reveal that the PL related to surface and bulk recombination is longer-lived at larger L, in line with the results based on electrical analysis. The meliorated transport properties with reduced charge trapping in MAPbI3 films can correlate to the slightly enhanced crystallinity and homogeneity in the grain size distribution in thicker films. The combinatorial study shows that the transport properties alongside traps in MAPbI3 films are tunable simply by the physical parameter of L. Meanwhile, our work points to the necessity to further reduce the trap density so as to boost the photovoltaic performance using perovskite thin films."
"To reduce intrinsic defect density in perovskite films, various additives are often added into the precursor solution. In this paper, a novel solution, in which isopropanol (IPA) was added into the precursor solution, was developed for the preparation of normal planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.70 % was achieved with this approach. By adding IPA into the precursor solution, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite showed better crystallization and stability, indicating improved film quality. Because of the improved morphology of perovskite crystal, the PCE of PSCs increased. In addition, the unencapsulated PSCs retained high output for up to 40 days in air at room temperature, indicating the stability of PSCs. These results may provide a new avenue for manufacturing high efficiency and high stability PSCs."
"In this study, we developed the universal encapsulation method using poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) to improve the water stability of perovskite solar cells. In order to enhance the moisture barrier property, we utilized SiO2 and graphene oxide (GO) fillers in the EVOH matrix. First, UV-treated SiO2 increased the dispersibility in the EVOH matrix and made the penetrating path more complicated, which led to a better moisture barrier property. The water vapor transmission ratio (WVTR) is enhanced from 4.72 × 10–2 (EVOH only) to 1.55 × 10–2 (EVOH with SiO2 filler) g/m2 day. Second, we found that GO reduce the unreacted hydroxyl groups that could attract water molecules at the surface of EVOH. The addition of GO increased the WVTR up to 3.34 × 10–3 g/m2 day. Finally, our EVOH-based film successfully encapsulated without the efficiency drop. The encapsulated devices surprisingly maintained 86% of their performance even under direct contact with water for 5 h."
Low-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (LDRP) perovskites are a current theme in solar energy research 
"A new approach to improve the quality of MAPbI3 − x Cl x perovskite film was demonstrated. It involves annealing the precursor film after pumping away the solvent, which can decrease the influence of solvent evaporation rate for the growth of the MAPbI3 − x Cl x perovskite film. The resulting film showed improved morphology, stronger absorption, fewer crystal defects, and smaller charge transfer resistance. The corresponding device demonstrated enhanced performance when compared with a reference device. The averaged value of power conversion efficiency increased from 10.61 to 12.56 %, and a champion efficiency of 14.0 % was achieved. This work paves a new way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells."
"Carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing interests due to low cost and excellent tolerances toward moisture, temperature, oxygen and ultraviolet light. However, carrier recombination of CsPbBr3 film and large energy level differences at CsPbBr3/carbon interface are still the most crucial problem for further enhancement of power conversion efficiency. In the current study, an intermediate energy level at CsPbBr3/carbon interface and CsPbBr3 film passivation are employed by coating hexane solution of CsPbBrxI3-x nanocrystals (NCs) on the perovskite layer. Through systematic study on interfacial engineering, it is found that CsPbBrxI3-x NCs with tunable energy level can remarkably reduce energy loss and hexane under passivation treatment can enlarge perovskite grain size as well as reduce trap state density. A champion power conversion efficiency of 9.45% is achieved for CsPbI3 NCs tailored all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC in comparison with 5.26% for NCs-free device, with the unencapsulated carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSC exhibiting remarkable long-term stability over 900 h in 80% relative humidity air atmosphere at 25 °C. This work provides an effective approach to promote charge extraction and reduce defect states density as well as enhance the performance of PSCs."
"Previously, benzotrithiophene (BTT)-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) had to be doped with three chemical agents for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSC). This work describes significant progress by which the first dopant-free BTT core-based HTM (YKP03) with EDOT spacers was readily accessed by step-saving direct C–H arylation. PSCs with dopant-free YKP03 showed promising efficiencies of up to 16.15% with potential long-term storage stability."
"Metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) as an important class of organic semiconductors or hole transport materials (HTMs) have been extensively used in organic solar cells. Nevertheless, most of them are highly insoluble and need to be processed through a strict high-vacuum deposition process. Herein, a solution-processable tert-butyl substituted zinc phthalocyanine (hereafter referred to as ZnPc(tBu)4) with relatively high hole mobility and favorable HOMO and LUMO levels has been synthesized and employed as dopant-free HTM layer in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the corresponding ZnPc(tBu)4-based PSCs after optimizing the ZnPc(tBu)4 concentration achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.16% and 7.98% measured under forward and reverse voltage scanning, respectively. The unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance of ZnPc(tBu)4-based PSCs compared to the classical spiro-OMeTAD-based ones can be mainly due to the very low fill factor and severe hysteresis, which would be eliminated by further optimizing the device fabrication procedure and the interfacial contacts between the mesoporous TiO2 film and MAPbI3 overlayer, and thus the present solution-processable and dopant-free ZnPc(tBu)4 would be a potential substitute for the expensive HTMs containing multifold additives used in the current PSCs."
"In this work, the effects of annealing temperature and time for one-step fabrication of mixed metal halide perovskite films were investigated. The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) improved from 8.30 to 10.85% after being annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and exhibited negligible photocurrent hysteresis when prepared at an ambient humidity of 70%. Besides, a high annealing temperature for a short time (150 °C; 1 min) shows comparable power conversion efficiency with perovskite annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The electronic properties of PSCs were characterized by photo induced charge extraction via linearly increasing the voltage (photo-CELIV), impedance, and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. Our finding suggests that the improvement in photovoltaic performance is correlated to the improved charge mobility, suppressed charge trapping, and prolonged recombination lifetime"
"Perovskite solar cells typically use TiO2 as charge extracting materials, which reduce the photostability of perovskite solar cells under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Simultaneously realizing the high efficiency and photostability, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed iron(III) oxide nanoisland electrodes consisting of discrete nanoislands in situ growth on the compact underlayer can be used as compatible and excellent electron extraction materials for perovskite solar cells. The uniquely designed iron(III) oxide electron extraction layer satisfies the good light transmittance and sufficient electron extraction ability, resulting in a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.2%. Most importantly, perovskite solar cells fabricated with iron(III) oxide show a significantly improved UV light and long-term operation stabilities compared with the widely used TiO2-based electron extraction material, owing to the low photocatalytic activity of iron(III) oxide. This study highlights the potential of incorporating new charge extraction materials in achieving photostable and high efficiency perovskite photovoltaic devices."
"Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their booming power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is usually limited by the quality of the perovskite film. Here, trace polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution as an additive for the crystalline defect passivation. The PVP with carbonyl delays the transition of the perovskite from the δ-phase to α-phase, which slows down the crystallization process. Thus, the crystallization rate of the α-phase perovskite can be controlled by forming coordination and a better film quality is achieved. As a result, we achieve a champion PCE of 19.63%, which is much higher than the 17.47% of the reference PSC. This study shows the mechanism of the material quality improvement by the additive during the perovskite film formation, where three processes are proposed to describe the film crystallization. We prove that the addition of PVP is an effective approach to improve the quality of the perovskite film, providing a valuable guidance for the development of high efficiency PSCs."
"In this study, chlorodeoxyhydroxyethylcellulose (CDHC) was synthesized from hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) through chlorination and then both HEC and CDHC were applied individually as additives within the methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) layers of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The architecture of the PVSCs was indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate/MAPbI3:cellulose derivative/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Ag. The photovoltaic (PV) properties of the HEC- and CDHC-incorporated PVSCs were superior to those of the corresponding pristine PVSC prepared without an additive, a result of decreases in the number of grain boundary defects as well as increases in the crystal grain sizes, crystallinities, and absorption intensities of the modified perovskite films. Moreover, the polymer chains of CDHC, presenting chlorine atoms, were particularly beneficial for enhancing the crystal size and crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film, resulting in the highest absorbance and PV performance in this study being those of a CDHC-doped PVSC. Indeed, this CDHC-incorporated PVSC displayed a short-circuit current density of 17.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V, a fill factor of 0.61, and a power conversion efficiency of 10.38%"
"Amelioration of the mobility and, in particular, the thermal stability of a hole-transporting molecular semiconductor is a practicable strategy to attain the enhancement of both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational durability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here a cost-effective double-[4]helicene-based molecular semiconductor (DBC-OMeDPA) is synthesized for a solution-deposited thin film, exhibiting an improved hole mobility in comparison with state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD control. X-ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation reveal the three-dimensional molecular stacking and multidirectional hole-transporting property of DBC-OMeDPA, clarifying the microscopic mechanism of the hole-transport process. A better PCE of 22% at the AM 1.5G conditions is achieved for PSCs with DBC-OMeDPA as the hole-transporter. Moreover, PSCs using DBC-OMeDPA characteristic of an elevated intrinsic glass transition temperature of 154 °C maintain a stable PCE output for hundreds of hours at 60 °C under equivalent full sunglight soaking."
"Low-temperature-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those fabricated on flexible substrates, exhibit device performance that is worse than that of high-temperature-processed PSCs. One of the main reasons for the inferior performance of low-temperature-processed PSCs is the loss of photogenerated electrons in the electron collection layer (ECL) or related interfaces, i.e., indium tin oxide/ECL and ECL/perovskite. Here, we report that tailoring of the energy level and electron transporting ability in oxide ECLs using Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and quantum dots notably minimizes the loss of photogenerated electrons in the low-temperature-fabricated flexible PSC. The proposed ECL with methylammonium lead halide [MAPb(I0.9Br0.1)3] leads to fabrication of significantly improved flexible PSCs with steady-state power conversion efficiency of 16.0% under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm–2 intensity. These results provide an effective method for fabricating high-performance, low-temperature solution-processed flexible PSCs."
"This work presents an inverted planar NH2CH = NH2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cell. FAPbI3 perovskite and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by the single-step method. The perovskite films have been characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FAPbI3 solar cell with short-circuit current density (Jsc ) = 14.48 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc ) = 0.88 V, fill factor (FF) = 68%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 8.62%, respectively. "
"Metal-halide perovskites show promise as highly efficient solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and other optoelectronic devices. Ensuring long-term stability is now a major priority. In this study, an ultrathin (2 nm) layer of polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is used to functionalize the surface of C60 for the subsequent deposition of atomic layer deposition (ALD) SnO2, a commonly used electron contact bilayer for p–i–n devices. The enhanced nucleation results in a more continuous initial ALD SnO2 layer that exhibits superior barrier properties, protecting Cs0.25FA0.75Pb(Br0.20I0.80)3 films upon direct exposure to high temperatures (200 °C) and water. This surface modification with PEIE translates to more stable solar cells under aggressive testing conditions in air at 60 °C under illumination. This type of “built-in” barrier layer mitigates degradation pathways not addressed by external encapsulation, such as internal halide or metal diffusion, while maintaining high device efficiency up to 18.5%. This nucleation strategy is also extended to ALD VOx films, demonstrating its potential to be broadly applied to other metal oxide contacts and device architectures."
"Organo-metal halide perovskites (OMHPs) are materials with attractive properties for optoelectronics. They made a recent introduction in the photovoltaics world by methylammonium (MA) lead triiodide and show remarkably improved charge separation capabilities when chloride and bromide are added. Here we show how halide substitution in OMHPs with the nominal composition CH3NH3PbI2X, where X is I, Br, or Cl, influences the morphology, charge quantum yield, and local interaction with the organic MA cation. X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence data demonstrate that halide substitution affects the local structure in the OMHPs with separate MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 phases. Raman spectroscopies as well as theoretical vibration calculations reveal that this at the same time delocalizes the charge to the MA cation, which can liberate the vibrational movement of the MA cation, leading to a more adaptive organic phase. The resonance Raman effect together with quantum chemical calculations is utilized to analyze the change in charge transfer mechanism upon electronic excitation and gives important clues for the mechanism of the much improved photovoltage and photocurrent also seen in the solar cell performance for the materials when chloride compounds are included in the preparation."
"The major restraint for the commercialization of the high-performance hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells is the long-term stability, especially at the infirm interface between the perovskite film and organic charge-transfer layer. Recently, engineering the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD becomes an effective strategy to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability in the perovskite solar cells. In this work, we demonstrated that introducing an interfacial polystyrene layer between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD layer can effectively improve the perovskite solar cells photovoltaic performance. The inserted polystyrene layer can passivate the interface traps and defects effectively and decrease the nonradiative recombination, leading to enhanced photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, without compromising the carrier extraction and transfer. Under the optimized condition, the perovskite solar cells with the polystyrene layer achieve an enhanced average power efficiency of about 19.61% (20.46% of the best efficiency) from about 17.63% with negligible current density–voltage hysteresis. Moreover, the optimized perovskite solar cells with the hydrophobic polystyrene layer can maintain about 85% initial efficiency after 2 months storage in open air conditions without encapsulation."
"Organic–inorganic lead perovskites have shown great promise as photovoltaic materials, and within this class of materials (CH3NH3)PbI3–xClx is of particular interest. Herein we use soft X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the methylammonium cations in a typical photovoltaic layer may dissociate into a metastable arrangement of CH3I–Pb2 defects and trapped NH3. The possibility that other metastable configurations of the organic components in (CH3NH3)PbI3–xClx is rarely considered but adds an entirely new dimension in understanding the charge trapping, ionic transport, and structural degradation mechanisms in these materials. Understanding the influence of these other configurations is of critical importance for further improving the performance of these photovoltaics."
"We obtain a novel kind of highly-conductive, low-temperature and perovskite-compatible carbon paste treated with the functional additives of titanium (IV) isopropoxide and acetic acid. The functional additives in the carbon paste can in si-tu generate newly complex polymeric Ti-O-Ti species acting as binder and plasticizer. It helps the electrical conductivity of carbon film increase to 1.13 × 104 S m−1, which corresponds to a sheet resistance of 4 Ω □−1 for a typical 20 μm film, superior to the transparent FTO/ITO electrode (15 Ω □−1). Then the carbon film is applied as the low-temperature carbon electrode into fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells and a champion efficiency of 14.04% is achieved. Meanwhile, the series resistance of device based on low-temperature carbon electrode can be reduced from 21 to 13 Ω cm2, compared to device based on high temperature carbon electrode only. This low-temperature, low cost, highly-conductive carbon film shows promising application in the future module design of fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells."
"The current work reports the concurrent passivation of interstitial and oxygen vacancy mediated defect states in low temperature processed ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) via Ultraviolet-Ozone (UVO) treatment for fabricating highly efficient (maximum efficiency: 16.70%), triple cation based MA0.57FA0.38Rb0.05PbI3 (MA: methyl ammonium, FA: formamidinium, Rb: rubidium) perovskite solar cell (PSC). Under UV exposure, ozone decomposes to free atomic oxygen and intercalates into the interstitial and oxygen vacancy induced defect sites in the ZnO lattice matrix, which contributes to suppressed trap-assisted recombination phenomena in perovskite device. UVO treatment also reduces the content of functional hydroxyl group on ZnO surface, that increases the inter-particle connectivity and grain size of perovskite film on UVO treated ZnO ETL. Owing to this, the perovskite film atop UVO treated ZnO film exhibits reduced micro-strain and dislocation density values, which contribute to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSC with modified ZnO ETL. The modified PSCs exhibit higher recombination resistance (RRec) ∼40% compared to pristine ZnO ETL based control devices. Adding to the merit, the UVO treated ZnO PSC also demonstrates superior device stability, retaining about 88% of its initial PCE in the course of a month-long, systematic degradation study."
"High-performance planar-heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells based on large band-gap (1.70–1.83 eV) perovskites are demonstrated. By incorporating Cl− into the MAPb(I1-YBrY)3, the crystallinity and homogeneity of the solution-processed perovskite thin films are much improved, which results in an increased charge carrier diffusion length from ≈160 nm to ≈700–800 nm. This enhancement leads to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% in the low-temperature solution-processed PHJ devices. "
"Recently, the thermally stable and facilely fabricated inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention where the electron transport layer (ETL) is vital. However, the typical sintering temperature for the widely used electron transport material, that is, TiO2, is more than 400 °C, elevating the cost and hindering the application. Due to high electron mobility and low fabrication temperature, ZnO becomes a desirable alternative for TiO2, as the ETL in CsPbIBr2 PSCs, albeit with low open-circuit voltage (Voc). Herein, this work introduces a trace of NH4Cl to the sol–gel-derived ZnO precursor to decrease the work function of the ZnO film, tune the surface morphology of the perovskite film, and thus suppress the density of trap states in the CsPbIBr2 films. Consequently, full-coverage and pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films consisting of micron-size and high-crystallinity grains are obtained. More importantly, for the optimal NH4Cl-modified ZnO, a shining improvement in Voc from 1.08 to 1.27 V boosts the champion CsPbIBr2 PSCs to obtain a power conversion efficiency of 10.16%, which is the highest value reported among pure-CsPbIBr2 PSCs under a low fabrication temperature of 160 °C. In addition, the NH4Cl-modified ZnO ETL reduces the severe hysteresis and increases the device stability significantly."
"All-inorganic perovskite solar cells provide a promising solution to tackle the thermal instability problem of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an all-inorganic perovskite solar cell with novel structure (FTO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/ZnO@C60/Ag), in which ZnO@C60 bilayer was utilized as the electron-transporting layers that demonstrated high carrier extraction efficiency and low leakage loss. Consequently, the as-fabricated all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.3% with a Voc of 1.14 V, Jsc of 15.2 mA·cm–2, and FF of 0.77. The corresponding stabilized power output (SPO) of the device was demonstrated to be ∼12% and remarkably stable within 1000 s. Importantly, the obtained all-inorganic PSCs without encapsulation exhibited only 20% PCE loss with thermal treatment at 85 °C for 360 h, which largely outperformed the organic-species-containing PSCs. The present study demonstrates potential in overcoming the intractable issue concerning the thermal instability of perovskite solar cells."
"Uniform and pinhole-free organic lead halide perovskite films in a large area are of paramount importance for achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar modules (PSMs). To obtain such high-quality perovskite films in a large area, one commonly needs to prepare a perovskite intermediate phase, in which coordinated solvent number (CSN) seems to be a key parameter. However, the CSN is difficult to measure and control. To understand the relationship between the CSN and perovskite film quality, in situ evolution of the intermediate phase is investigated. The CSN in the intermediate phase film is measured by the high-accuracy balance. Uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films are reproducibly formed by tuning the CSN in the intermediate phase film with a mixed antisolvent of ethyl acetate (EA) and toluene (Tol) blended with a 1:1 volume ratio. A hole conductor–free PSM (10 × 10 cm2) thus fabricates and, based on printable carbon electrode, achieves a PCE of 10.2% in 52 cm2 active area. This effective method provides a promising direction for developing high-quality and large-area perovskite films for photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications."
"A two-step method is widely used to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In a typical two-step method, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites are fabricated from PbI2 films through an intercalation reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, which usually have a rough surface and residual PbI2 due to a compact PbI2 structure. Here, we introduce some strong Lewis bases into PbI2/DMF solutions in the first step, which is helpful in controlling the morphology of PbI2 films with a mesoporous structure. The mesopores in the PbI2 films provide not only space for accommodating the volume expansion during the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, but also channels for CH3NH3I solution to diffuse into the PbI2 films, which helps eliminate the residual PbI2 and the dissolution and recrystallization process. As a result, smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2 are easily obtained. The power conversion efficiency, stability and reproducibility of the perovskite solar cells fabricated from the optimized mesoporous PbI2 films improved simultaneously due to the improvement in perovskite films. This work reveals the key roles of solvents (boiling point, Lewis basicity) in controlling the microstructure of the PbI2 films."
"In this communication, glycine, an amino acid, was applied to modify the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction interface for reducing the inevitable defects formed during crystallization of perovskite. The power conversion efficiency of the resulting perovskite solar cell was increased from 8.35 to 12.02%, attributed to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density."
"Four novel benzotriazole-based donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) type hole transport materials (HTMs) BTA1-2 and DT1-2 are synthesized to investigate the effect of the acceptors on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The acceptors include nonfused core (thiophene-benzotriazole-thiophene) and fused core (dithienopyrrolobenzotriazole, DTBT). Systematical investigation reveals that the acceptor greatly influences the absorption, energy level, hole transfer and extraction, and photovoltaic performances of the HTMs. The dopant-free HTMs DT1-2 with DTBT core exhibit better hole transfer and extraction performance, and then obtain better photovoltaic performance than that of BTA1-2. Especially, the PSC using DT2 without any dopants obtains a power conversion efficiency of 13.22%, which is outperforming than that of spiro-OMeTAD (10.41%). When doping with Li-TFSI/TBP (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide/tert-butylpyridine), DT2-based cell achieves an improved efficiency of 15.77%. In addition, the different alkoxyl chain lengths on triphenylamine has a significant impact on the conductivity, hole mobility, hole extraction, and photovoltaic performance. The stability testing of the PSCs shows that the four HTMs based devices display improved stability than spiro-OMeTAD. These results certify that the fused acceptor core DTBT is a promising core for efficient D-A-D type HTMs towards PSCs."
"Reactive sputtering is a versatile technique used to form compact films with excellent homogeneity. In addition, it allows easy control over deposition parameters such as gas flow rate that results in changes on composition and thus in the film required properties. In this report, reactive sputtering is used to deposit niobium oxide films. A niobium target is used as metal source and different oxygen flow rates to deposit niobium oxide films. The oxygen flow rate was changed from 3 to 10 sccm. The films deposited under low oxygen flow rates show higher electrical conductivity and provide better perovskite solar cells when used as electron transport layer. "
"We demonstrate efficiency enhancement in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing a free-dopant hole transporting material (HTM), non-peripherally substituted octapentyl phthalocyanine (C5PcH2) with thermal annealing. Particularly, by using thermal annealing approach, the external quantum efficiency at around 480 nm increase from 78 to 84%. Hence, the fill factor and short-circuit current density are markedly improved from 0.35 ± 0.02 to 0.55 ± 0.05 and from 18 ± 1 to 18.8 ± 0.3 mA cm-2, respectively. Finally, the best device is achieved with power conversion efficiencies of 12.2% by annealing at 130 °C for 10 min. The photoluminescence and photo-induced charge carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltages measurements indicate that the charge carrier mobility in C5PcH2 increases, and thereby the hole extraction and transportation from the perovskite layer to the Au anode as well the photovoltaic performance of PCS is improved by using thermal annealing processing"
"Chemical doping of organic semiconductors has been recognized as an effective way to enhance the electrical conductivity. In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), various types of dopants have been developed for organic hole transport materials (HTMs); however, the knowledge of the basic requirements for being efficient dopants as well as the comprehensive roles of the dopants in PSCs has not been clearly revealed. Here, three copper-based complexes with controlled redox activities are applied as dopants in PSCs, and it is found that the oxidative reactivity of dopants presents substantial impacts on conductivity, charge dynamics, and solar cell performance. A significant improvement of open-circuit voltage (Voc) by more than 100 mV and an increase of power conversion efficiency from 13.2 to 19.3% have been achieved by tuning the doping level of the HTM. The observed large variation of Voc for three dopants reveals their different recombination kinetics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces and suggests a model of an interfacial recombination mechanism. We also suggest that the dopants in HTMs can also affect the charge recombination kinetics as well as the solar cell performance. Based on these findings, a strategy is proposed to physically passivate the electron–hole recombination by inserting an ultrathin Al2O3 insulating layer between the perovskite and the HTM. This strategy contributes a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability, indicating that dopant engineering is one crucial way to further improve the performance of PSCs."
"The HC(NH2)2+(FA+) is a well-known substitute to CH3NH3+(MA+) for its capability to extend light utilization for improved power conversion efficiency for perovskite solar cells; unfortunately, the dark cubic phase (α-phase) can easily transition to the yellow orthorhombic phase (δ-phase) at room temperature, an issue that prevents its commercial application. In this report, an inorganic material (NbF5) is developed to stabilize the desired α-phase perovskite material by incorporating NbF5 additive into the perovskite films. It is found that the NbF5 additive effectively suppresses the formation of the yellow δ-phase in the perovskite synthesis and aging process, thus enhancing the humidity and light-soaking stability of the perovskite film. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the NbF5 additive exhibit improved air stability by tenfold, retaining nearly 80% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 50 d. In addition, under full-sun AM 1.5 G illumination of a xenon lamp without any UV-reduction, the perovskite solar cells with the NbF5 additive also show fivefold improved illumination stability than the control devices without NbF5"
"Solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as a very promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their superior semiconducting properties. Although the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has already been demonstrated to rival those of the prevailing inorganic counterparts, the device's long-term stability under thermal, photo-, and moisture stresses has been raised as one major challenge before the commercialization of this technology. Here, we have designed and synthesized a crosslinkable n-type conjugated molecule, c-HATNA, to serve as the electron-transporting layer on top of the perovskite to improve photo-, moisture, and thermal stability of the fabricated PVSCs. This work has validated the method of incorporating facile crosslinkable charge transport layers to improve efficiency and ambient and thermal stability of resultant solar cells to benefit large-scale device fabrication."
"Electron-transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface modification plays a key task for producing efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, interfacial modification of compact TiO2 using novel, one-step hydrothermally synthesized single-crystalline anatase (AT) titania nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) (average diameter = 6–10 nm) was applied as an ETL bilayer to enhance the efficient charge generation and extraction and eliminate the electron–hole recombination ratio. We report here an easy approach for enhancing the performance of planar PSCs by introducing a compact TiO2/AT TiO2 NPs bilayer through spray pyrolysis (SP) deposition and spin-coating (SC) techniques, respectively. The enhanced performance of the devices with an SP-TiO2/SC-AT TiO2 NPs bilayer facilitated more efficient electron transport, charge extraction, and low interfacial recombination. Ultimately, the best device had a 17.05% power conversion efficiency resulting from the significant decrease in J–V hysteresis, presenting almost a 12% performance improvement compared to the TiO2 only layer-based counterpart. Thus, the present study provides an important advance to the design of photovoltaic devices with respect to charge transport and electron–hole recombination."
"The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes is an important endeavor toward achieving high-efficiency solar energy conversion. Now, a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy is used to judiciously create an amorphous TiO2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO2 surface as an electron-transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO2 surface. Such amorphous TiO2-coated ETL possesses an increased electron density owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Compared to pristine TiO2-based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO2 ETL exhibit an enhanced short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency"
"In this work, four tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-centered hole transport materials (HTMs), with 2,7- or 3,6-substituted carbazole derivatives as periphery groups are deliberately synthesized and characterized. Their photophysical properties, energy levels, and photovoltaic performances are systematically investigated, and their performances as HTMs are discussed with respect to the different substituent positions on the carbazole moiety. It is interesting to find that the TPE-based HTMs with 2,7-carbazole substituents rival the 3,6-carbazole substituents in hole mobility and hole extraction ability. A high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.74 % is achieved for the devices based on the 2,7-carbazole periphery arms, which is even higher than the one of the “star” HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2-7,7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenylamine 9,9′-spirobifluorene) under the same conditions. As far as we know, this is the highest efficiency achieved in tetraphenylethylene derivatives."
"CuO nanowires (NWs) with the diameters ranging from 130 to 275 nm have been successfully prepared by electrospinning technique, followed by a calcination process. Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the structure of indium tin oxide/CuO NWs/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulphonate) (PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Bphen/Ag were designed, achieving a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.87%, which is 21% improvement compared to that of the control PSCs without CuO NWs. By the characterizations of an optical microscope, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy, it was found that CuO NWs have uniform morphology and orderly arrangement. Electrochemical impedance spectrometry and external quantum efficiency were used to reveal the effect of CuO NWs on the performance of PSCs. Compared to ZnO NWs with the same diameters and quantitative analysis based on a simple model, we conclude that the improvement of PCE by about 13% can be ascribed to the increase of the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 interface area and the remaining increase of 8% can be attributed to the higher hole mobility of the CuO NWs/PEDOT:PSS composite film. The results indicate that the efficiency of PSCs will have a significant enhancement when the optimal CuO NWs are introduced into the charge transport layer."
"A new small molecular hole-transporting material, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-amino]pyrene (TFAP) was synthesized and applied in CH3NH3PbI3-perovskite solar cells. A best power conversion efficiency of 19.7% with a photovoltage of 1.11 V has been achieved."
"It is well known that the different proportions of CuO and Cu2O in CuOx hole transfer materials have a great influence on the hole transport property as well as the device performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, we changed the content of Cu2O in the film by controlling the deposition voltage during electrodeposition, and the effects of different contents of Cu2O in the films on the device were investigated for the first time. It was found that the content of Cu2O in the film reached the highest point with the deposition voltage 0.5V, such films have the highest transmittance and carrier mobility. After assembling the device, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the champion device reached 13.48% under a one-sun AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination. Furthermore, the unpackaged device based on CuOx still retained over 75% PCE after being placed in the ambient condition (30–40% humidity, 20–30∘C) for 500h"
We report a clear correlation of the features observed in photocurrent noise-fluctuations to the performance parameters of hybrid perovskite solar cells. The general trend of increasing noise amplitude which spreads over a wider range of frequency as a function of aging is established. High-resolution spatial mapping of the photocurrent in typical devices and the associated variation of the noise spectrum confirms the underlying trend.
"All-inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskites (CsPbI3) are promising wide-bandgap materials for use in the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, but they easily undergo a phase transition from a cubic black phase to an orthorhombic yellow phase under ambient conditions. It is shown that this phase transition is triggered by moisture that causes distortion of the corner-sharing octahedral framework ([PbI6]4−). Here, a novel strategy to suppress the octahedral tilting of [PbI6]4− units in cubic CsPbI3 by systematically controlling the steric hindrance of surface organic terminal groups is provided. This steric hindrance effectively prevents the lattice distortion and thus increases the energy barrier for phase transition. This mechanism is verified by X-ray diffraction measurements and density functional theory calculations. Meanwhile, the formation of an organic capping layer can also passivate the surface electronic trap states of perovskite absorber. These modifications contribute to a stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% for the inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is the highest efficiency achieved by the inverted-structure inorganic PSCs. More importantly, the optimized devices retained 85% of their initial PCE after aging under ambient conditions for 30 days"
"Sn-doped TiO2 films are successfully co-electrodeposited from a single bath containing TiCl3 and SnCl2, providing a new and facile method for the preparation of metal-doped TiO2 thin films. Through systematic examinations on the film morphologies, optical, and electronic properties of the electrodeposited TiO2 films with different Sn-doping amount, it is utilized as the electron-transporting layer (ETL) in a perovskite solar cell (PSC). The photovoltaic performance of PSCs equipped with electrodeposited Sn-doped TiO2 ETL is improved considerably, which is mainly attributed to the increased carrier concentration and improved electron extraction capability due to Sn-doping. Currently, power conversion efficiency of planar-type PSC using 5% (molar ratio) Sn-doped TiO2 ETL achieves 16.8%, corresponding to a 9.8% improvement when comparing with the sample using pure TiO2 (15.3%)."
"High efficiency and stable hole transporting material-free (HTM-free) planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells are constructed by directly thermal evaporating perovskite materials onto indium tin oxide substrate. A condense and homogeneous morphology is found for this perovskite film even without any annealing process. The optimized HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/C60 PHJ device with a 35 nm ultra-thin CH3NH3PbI3−XClX layer presents a high hole extraction efficiency and a low charge carrier recombination probability, which results in a high short circuit current and fill factor. The HTM-free device shows a high power conversion efficiency of 8.37%, which is one of the highest efficiency among reported inverted HTM-free perovskite solar cells even that a thinner perovskite film is used. More importantly, the device also exhibits a superior stability in ambient conditions."
"Due to the additional introduction of bulky organic ammonium and the competition between bulky organic ammonium and methyl ammonium in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (2DRP) perovskite, the crystallization process becomes complicated. Here, it is demonstrated that the rapid crystallization controlled by processing solvents plays an important role in achieving high-quality 2DRP perovskite films. It is found that the processing solvents, e.g., dimethylacetamide (DMAC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with a different polarity and boiling point, have almost no effect on crystal structure and phase distribution but have a remarkable effect on crystallization kinetics, crystal growth orientation, and crystallinity of 2DRP perovskite. Compared to polar aprotic solvent DMF and DMSO with a high boiling point, DMAC with low polarity and a suitable boiling point has a weak coordination to lead and ammonium salts and is easy to escape during solution processing, which is able to accelerate the crystallization rate of 2DRP perovskite. Benefitting from the rapid crystallization enabled high-quality 2DRP perovskite films, the best-performing device with improved stability and a power conversion efficiency of 12.15% is obtained using DMAC solvent. These findings may give guidance for solvent engineering for highly efficient 2DRP perovskite solar cells in the future."
"wo organic-inorganic halide CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared in the same experimental batch but having different power conversion efficiencies −18.46% and 17.15%—were investigated based on the absolute electroluminescence (EL) efficiency measurements and traditional I-V measurements. The possible factors that affect the power conversion efficiency were also investigated. Comparing the experimental I-V curves of the two solar cells, it was found that the short-circuit currents (Jsc) were nearly the same; however, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) were markedly different. Moreover, the deduced I-V curves from the absolute EL efficiencies of the two solar cells, which were mainly affected by the material quality, were almost the same, proving that the device processing technology has a vital effect on Voc."
"It has been reported that nonradiative charge carrier recombination in hybrid perovskite materials restricts the device performance of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we report efficient perovskite solar cells through suppressed nonradiative charge carrier recombination by a processing additive, aminopropanoic acid. It is found that aminopropanoic acid not only modulates the crystal growth processes but also minimizes the defects of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit both enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence and elongated charge carrier lifetime, indicating that nonradiative charge carrier recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films is drastically suppressed. As a result, perovskite solar cells fabricated using the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit approximately 15% enhanced efficiency as compared with those made with pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. All of these results demonstrate that our findings provide a facile way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells."
"Four different functional groups including amino (−NH2), phosphine (−PH2), hydroxyl (−OH), and thiol (−SH) were combined with POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) molecules to investigate how functional groups affect the surface passivation of POSS systems. Results from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that functional group amino (−NH2) with adsorption energy 86 (56) kJ mol–1 is consistently better than that of thiol (−SH) with adsorption energy 68 (43) kJ mol–1 for different passivation mechanisms. Theoretical studies on the analogous POSS–OH and POSS–PH2 systems show similar adsorption energies. Two of the systems were also investigated experimentally; aminopropyl isobutyl POSS (POSS–NH2) and mercaptopropyl isobutyl POSS (POSS–SH) were applied as passivation materials for MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite and (FA)0.85(MA)0.15Pb(I3)0.85(Br3)0.15 (FA = formamidinium) perovskite films. The same conclusion was drawn based on the results from contact angle studies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the stability of solar cells in ambient atmosphere, indicating the vital importance of choice of functional groups for passivation of the perovskite materials."
"Inverted perovskite solar cells have attracted a great deal of attention due to its high power conversion efficiency, simple configuration, and low-cost processing. The hole transport material (HTM) is a crucial factor in high performance inverted perovskite solar cell. However, the hole mobility for most common of HTM is too low to matching perovskite materials. Herein, we report a superior HTM with high hole mobility to significantly improve solar cell efficiency. Upon doing the commonly used PEDOT:PSS HTM by graphene oxide (GO), its hole mobility is increased from 5.55 × 10−5 to 1.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, leading to efficient hole extraction and low current leakage, therefore 20% higher power conversion efficiency comparing to the control device without the GO doping. The development open the opportunities for efficient HTMs based on the two-dimensional materials in the perovskite solar cells."
"Solvent engineering has been considered a reliable process for the fabrication of pinhole-free and highly crystalline perovskite thin films. Recently, green solvents have received immense attention, as the toxic antisolvents used in the conventional fabrication process cause environmental and health hazards. In this regard, ethyl acetate (EA) is a promising environmentally friendly antisolvent. Here, we present the fabrication of perovskites with controlled morphologies by changing the composition of the perovskite and the volume of EA in ambient humidity. The incorporation of [HC(NH2)2]PbIBr2 into a CH3NH3PbI3 matrix results in a grain size up to ~1.5 μm. This induces a considerable reduction of trap density, leading to the suppression of charge recombination and, consequently, improvement in the photoluminescence characteristics. The resulting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized devices are 20.93% and 19.51% for active areas of 0.12 cm2 and 0.7 cm2, respectively. The reduced diffusion of moisture along grain boundaries improves device stability. Further, by virtue of the excellent humidity resistance of EA, the film morphologies obtained at high relative humidity (50%) are similar to those obtained under dry conditions, exhibiting an impressive PCE of 20.11%. We believe that our optimized fabrication process using EA can be extended to other green antisolvent systems."
"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low cost and high efficiency. In general, the Au cathode, a key component in PSCs, is prepared via an uneconomic vacuum thermal deposition method. Instead, the sputtering deposition method is much more economic and faster. However, it is generally thought that the organic hole transport layer such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) can be easily damaged by the high energy plasma during the sputtering process. Thus, the performance of the PSCs greatly decreases. Herein, the structure of the planar PSCs is carefully manipulated by matching the thickness of Spiro-OMeTAD layer and the Au film. With the further engineering of the interface of the Au/Spiro-OMeTAD, the planar PSCs with the sputtered Au cathode exhibit a highly reproducible average efficiency of 17.6% ± 0.8%, with the best efficiency of 18.3%. In addition, the Cu electrode is demonstrated by the sputtering method. Finally, the Au sputter deposition is scaled up to make a high efficiency (14.7%) 10 × 10 cm2 module. This demonstrates well that the sputtering deposition of the metal cathode is an effective way for the fabrication of high efficient PSCs for future industrialization."
"Producing high efficiency solar cells without high-temperature processing or use of additives still remains a challenge with the two-step process. Here, the solution processing of MAPbI3 from PbI2 films in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is investigated. In-situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements reveal a sol–gel process involving three PbI2-DMF solvate complexes—disordered (P0) and ordered (P1, P2)—prior to PbI2 formation. When the appropriate solvated state of PbI2 is exposed to MAI (methylammonium Iodide), it can lead to rapid and complete room temperature conversion into MAPbI3 with higher quality films and improved solar cell performance. Complementary in-situ optical reflectance, absorbance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements show that dry PbI2 can take up only one third of the MAI taken up by the solvated-crystalline P2 phase of PbI2, requiring additional annealing and yet still underperforming. The perovskite solar cells fabricated from the ordered P2 precursor show higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reproducibility than devices fabricated from other cases. The average PCE of the solar cells is greatly improved from 13.2(±0.53)% (from annealed PbI2) to 15.7(±0.35)% (from P2) reaching up to 16.2%. This work demonstrates the importance of controlling the solvation of PbI2 as an effective strategy for the growth of high-quality perovskite films and their application in high efficiency and reproducible solar cells"
"In PIN-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hydroscopicity and acidity of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL) have critical influences on the device stability. To eliminate these problems, Nafion, the hydrophobic perfluorosulfonic copolymer, is incorporated into PEDOT:PSS by a simple spin-coating process. For the modified film, Nafion/PSSH (poly(styrene sulfonate) acid) acts as an electron-blocking layer on the surface and the PEDOT-rich domain tends to gather into larger particles with better interchain charge transfer inside the film. Consequently, the modified PEDOT:PSS HTL shows enhanced conductivity and light transmittance as well as more favorable work function, ending up with the increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. Finally, PSCs with Nafion-modified HTLs achieve the best power conversion efficiency of 16.72%, with 23.76% improvement compared with PEDOT:PSS-only devices (13.51%). Most importantly, the device stability is obviously enhanced because of the hydrophobicity and chemical and mechanical stability of the Nafion polymer that is enriched on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film"
"High efficiency and long-term stability are vital for further development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs based on cesium lead halide perovskites exhibit better stability but lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), compared with organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. Lower PCE is likely associated with trap defects, overgrowth of partial crystals and irreversible phase transition in the films. Here we introduce a strategy to fabricate high-efficiency CsPbBr3-based PSCs by controlling the ratio of CsBr and PbBr2 to form the perovskite derivative phases (CsPb2Br5/Cs4PbBr6) via a vapor growth method. Following post-annealing, the perovskite derivative phases as nucleation sites transform to the pure CsPbBr3 phase accompanied by crystal rearrangements and retard rapid recrystallization of perovskite grains. This growth procedure induced by phase transition not only makes the grain size of perovskite films more uniform, but also lowers the surface potential barrier that existsbetween the crystals and grain boundaries. Owing to the improved film quality, a PCE of 10.91% was achieved for n-i-p structured PSCs with silver electrodes, and a PCE of 9.86% for hole-transport-layer-free devices with carbon electrodes. Moreover, the carbon electrode-based devices exhibited excellent long-term stability and retained 80% of the initial efficiency in ambient air for more than 2000 h without any encapsulation."
"Organometal-halide perovskites continue to attract a large number of solar enthusiasts due to their intrinsic properties as promising solar absorbers with relatively low processing cost. However, commercialization of perovskite solar cells remains distant, especially in the planar perovskite configuration, because of various problems such as inconsistency, poor environmental stability, and small-scale production. In this study, we present the use of complimentary electron transporting layers (ETLs) as a highly effective approach to cover the weaknesses of individual ETLs while boosting the strengths of various ETL compositions. Heterogeneous AITO/SnO2 ETL based device demonstrates paramount efficiency of 18.90% and exhibits superior stability maintaining 93% of its initial efficiency after 25 days in the absence of encapsulation at relative humidity of 30–40%. Furthermore, the simple addition of a consistent AITO layer allows improvement in reproducibility, while the simple addition of a SnO2 layer exhibits significant enhancement in electron mobility and reduction in recombination sites at the AITO/perovskite interface. In essence, our results suggest the use of compatible heterogeneous ETLs as an appealing method to provide synergistic enhancements in various photovoltaic parameters, device stability, and also device reproducibility of planar perovskite devices."
"For commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the device stability issues attributed to degradation of perovskite material, photo and thermal instability, and photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis behavior should be solved. Furthermore, most of presented high efficiency PSCs utilize an antisolvent-strategy to assist perovskite crystal growth with large grain-size and excellent coverage. To solve such issues, we developed fully-ambient-air and antisolvent-free processes for the fabrication of PSCs with perovskite-based composites (i.e., MAPbI3-xClx-Cu:NiO, MAPbI3-xClx-Cu:NiO-carbon-graphite and MAPbI3-xClx-Al2O3). Such perovskite composites based cells with interface engineering yielded high power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 18.6% and fill factor (FF) of 78.3% with excellent reproducibility. More importantly, the target cells showed hysteresis-free behavior and dramatic enhancement in air-, photo- and thermal-stability. Compared to the pristine cells, the target device showed remarkable long-term stability with retaining almost 100% of the initial values of Voc and Jsc, and ~94% of FF and PCE over 280 days."
"Electrochemical benzylation of [60]fullerene-fused lactones with different motifs unexpectedly affords three types of ring-opened benzylated adducts under different conditions. Both [60]fullerene-fused δ- and γ-lactones can be benzylated to generate ring-opened mono- and bis-benzylated adducts in good yields. In addition, representative fullerene products have been applied as efficient electron-transport materials in perovskite solar cells."
"Two monomers, M:OO and M:ON, and their corresponding polymers, P:OO and P:ON, were prepared from styrene derivatives N,N-diphenyl-4-vinyl-aniline with different substituents (–OCH3 and –N(CH3)2) in the N-phenyl para positions. The polymers were synthesised and fully characterised to study their function as hole transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The thermal, optical and electrochemical properties and performance of these monomers and polymers as HTMs in PSCs were compared in terms of their structure. The polymers form more stable amorphous glassy states and showed higher thermal stability than the monomers. The different substituent in the para position influenced the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, altering the oxidation potential. Both monomers and polymers were employed as HTMs in perovskite solar cells with a device configuration FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 7.48% for M:OO, 5.14% for P:OO, 5.28% for P:ON and 3.52% for M:ON. Although showing comparatively low efficiencies, the polymers showed much superior reproducibility in comparison with Spiro-OMeTAD or the monomers, suggesting further optimisation of polymeric HTMs with redox side groups is warranted."
"2D perovskites have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent stability compared with 3D perovskites. However, the intrinsic hydrophilicity of introduced alkylammonium salts effects the humidity stability of 2D/3D perovskites. Devices based on longer chain alkylammonium salts show improvement in hydrophobicity but lower efficiency due to the poorer charge transport among various layers. To solve this issue, two hydrophobic short-chain alkylammonium salts with halogen functional groups (2-chloroethylamine, CEA+ and 2-bromoethylamine, BEA+) are introduced into (Cs0.1FA0.9)Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 3D perovskites to form 2D/3D perovskite structure, which achieve high-quality perovskite films with better crystallization and morphology. The optimal 2D/3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 5% CEA+ display a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 20.08% under 1 sun irradiation. Because of the notable hydrophobicity of alkylammonium cations with halogen functional groups and the formed 2D/3D perovskite structure, the optimal PSCs exhibit superior moisture resistance and retain 92% initial PCE after aging at 50 ± 5% relative humidity for 2400 h. This work opens up a new direction for the design of new-type 2D/3D PSCs with improved performance by employing proper alkylammonium salts with different functional groups."
"Organolead halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I and Br) have attracted considerable attention since they were first used in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009.1 Park et al.2 conducted a pioneer work on solid-state solar cells with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals in 2012. In the same year, Snaith et al.3 also gained a breakthrough achievement on solid-state solar cells with an insulating Al2O3 layer. Afterwards, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells with CH3NH3PbX3, called perovskite solar cells (PSCs), rapidly increased to more than 22%"
"Thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements are used to characterize electronic trap states in methylammonium lead iodide perovsite solar cells. Several TSC peaks were observed over the temperature range from 20 K to room temperature. To elucidate the origins of these peaks, devices with various organic charge transport layers and devices without transport layers were tested. Two peaks appear at very low temperatures, indicating shallow trap states that are mainly attributed to the PCBM/C60 electron transport bilayer. However, two additional peaks appear at higher temperatures, that is, they are deeper in energy, and are assigned to the perovskite layer. At around T = 163 K, a sharp peak, also present in the dark TSC measurements, is assigned to the orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition in the perovskite. However, a peak at around T = 191 K is assigned to trap states with activation energies of around 500 meV but with a rather low concentration of 1 × 1021 m–3."
"Novel symmetric oligomer hole transporting materials (HTMs) incorporating 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) cores have been synthesized and tested for high performance perovskite solar cells. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 14.23% has been achieved by employing DPEDOT-B[BMPDP]2 with the electron donating EDOT unit as the core, which is comparable to that of the traditional spiro-OMeTAD (14.55%)."
"Based on self-assembly, novel electron extraction layers (EELs) composed of naphthalimide (NPI) derivatives are constructed for application in n-i-p perovskite solar cells. Upon molecular energy level modulation, the power conversion efficiencies have been largely improved from 5.4% to 16%. Such low-cost and highly regulable EELs are promising for future commercial applications."
"The short-circuit current density of inverted perovskite solar cells is unsatisfactory due to the intrinsic relatively low electron mobility and electrical conductivity of PC61BM. To solve this problem, a solution-processed mixed-fullerene derivative electron transporting material by mixing PC61BM with C60 was developed to improve charge extraction capacity in fully low temperature processed devices. Incorporation of C60 into the PC61BM layer improves the mobility from 2.15×10−3 to 4.71×10−3 cm2⋅V−1⋅s−1 and the conductivity of electron transporting layers, thus enhancing the interfacial electron extraction capacity and reducing the electron transfer resistance. As a result, the average power conversion efficiency increases from 12.80% to 15.47% by 21% due to the significant increases in the average short-circuit current density from 19.26 to 22.08 mA⋅cm−2 by 15%. Meanwhile, the optimal efficiency of 16.44% with rigid substrates and 12.93% with flexible substrates are obtained with almost no hysteresis. This work provides a novel and simple method to greatly improve the short-circuit current density and hence the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells."
"The stability of a tin-based perovskite solar cell is a major challenge. Here, hybrid tin-based perovskite solar cells in a new series that incorporate a nonpolar organic cation, guanidinium (GA+), in varied proportions into the formamidinium (FA+) tin triiodide perovskite (FASnI3) crystal structure in the presence of 1% ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) as an additive, are reported. The device performance is optimized at a precursor ratio (GAI:FAI) of 20:80 to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.5% when prepared freshly; the efficiencies continuously increase to attain a record PCE of 9.6% after storage in a glove-box environment for 2000 h. The hybrid perovskite works stably under continuous 1 sun illumination for 1 h and storage in air for 6 days without encapsulation. Such a tin-based perovskite passes all harsh standard tests, and the efficiency of a fresh device, 8.3%, is certified. The great performance and stability of the device reported herein attains a new milestone for lead-free perovskite solar cells on a path toward commercial development."
"Indium oxide (In2O3) as a promising n-type semiconductor material has been widely employed in optoelectronic applications. In this work, we applied low-temperature solution-processed In2O3 nanocrystalline film as an electron selective layer (ESL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. By taking advantages of good optical and electrical properties of In2O3 such as high mobility, wide band gap, and high transmittance, we obtained In2O3-based PSCs with a good efficiency exceeding 13% after optimizing the concentration of the precursor solution and the annealing temperature. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the In2O3-based PSCs, a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer was introduced to modify the surface of the In2O3 film. The PCBM film could fill up the pinholes or cracks along In2O3 grain boundaries to passivate the defects and make the ESL extremely compact and uniform, which is conducive to suppressing the charge recombination. As a result, the efficiency of the In2O3-based PSC was improved to 14.83% accompanied with VOC, JSC, and FF being 1.08 V, 20.06 mA cm–2, and 0.685, respectively."
"The ideal charge transport materials should exhibit a proper energy level, high carrier mobility, sufficient conductivity, and excellent charge extraction ability. Here, a novel electron transport material was designed and synthesized by using a simple and facile solvothermal method, which is composed of the core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles. Thanks to the good match between the energy level of the SnO2 shell and the high electron mobility of the core ZnO nanoparticles, the PCE of inorganic perovskite solar cells has reached 14.35% (JSC: 16.45 mA cm–2, VOC: 1.11 V, FF: 79%), acting core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles as the electron transfer layer. The core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles size is 8.1 nm with the SnO2 shell thickness of 3.4 nm, and the electron mobility is seven times more than SnO2 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the uniform core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles is extremely favorable to the growth of inorganic perovskite films. These preliminary results strongly suggest the great potential of this novel electron transfer material in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells."
"Biaxially-extended octithiophene-based conjugated polymers are demonstrated as effective polymeric hole-transporting layers (HTLs) to simultaneously enhance the efficiency and UV-photostability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The intense UV absorption contributed from the conjugated side-chain groups of such polymers facilitated its function of UV filtering when serving as the bottom HTL in PVSCs. Through rationally tailoring polymer backbone structure, a highly efficient (PCE: 18.34%) PVSC with much improved UV-photostability and ambient stability was successfully achieved."
"A small amount of a radical-bearing redox-active polymer, poly(1-oxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA), incorporated into the photovoltaic organo-lead halide perovskite layer significantly enhanced durability of both the perovskite layer and its solar cell and even exposure to ambient air or oxygen. PTMA acted as an eliminating agent of the superoxide anion radical formed upon light irradiation on the layer, which can react with the perovskite compound and decompose it to lead halide. A cell fabricated with a PTMA-incorporated perovskite layer and a hole-transporting polytriarylamine layer gave a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 18.8 % (18.2 % for the control without PTMA). The photovoltaic current was not reduced in the presence of PTMA in the perovskite layer probably owing to a carrier conductivity of PTMA. The incorporated PTMA also worked as a water-repelling coating for providing humidity-resistance to the organo-lead halide perovskite laye"
"Currently the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells is still lower than that of normal structured devices, due to the imperfect band alignment between the perovskite and hole transport layer (NiO). Herein, we found that the presence of oxygen during film preparation could lower the Fermi level of NiO and decrease the energy mismatch between the perovskite and NiO. The decreased mismatch benefited the VOC of the devices as well as the charge transfer between NiO and the perovskite. In addition, the utilization of Cs–MA–FA mixed ion-based perovskites as absorbers could increase the light response range and improve the thermal and moisture stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Finally, we achieved a stable performance output of 19.2% for inverted planar perovskite solar cells without any hysteresis."
"We developed lead halide perovskite quantum dot (QD) solar cells with a combinational absorbing layer based on stacked α-CsPbI3 and FAPbI3. α-CsPbI3 QDs, with a relatively wide bandgap of 1.75 eV, are not ideal for single-junction solar cells. We show that the absorption can be broadened by the introduction of another QD layer with a narrower bandgap like FAPbI3. The α-CsPbI3/FAPbI3 structure together with thermal annealing can improve the electrical coupling in the FAPbI3 layer and induce A-site cation exchange to develop a graded heterojunction for more efficient charge extraction. A highest power conversion efficiency of 15.6% and improved ambient stability have been achieved for the bilayer structured solar cells. More interestingly, the perovskite QDs provided a facile way to fabricate multiple layers and quantum junctions for optoelectronic applications via layer-by-layer deposition, which cannot be realized in solution-processed perovskite thin-film devices."
"Inspired by the rapid rise in efficiencies of lead halide perovskite (LHP) solar cells, lead-free alternatives are attracting increasing attention. In this work, we study the photovoltaic potential of solution-processed antimony (Sb)-based compounds with the formula A3Sb2I9 (A = Cs, Rb, and K). We experimentally determine bandgap magnitude and type, structure, carrier lifetime, exciton binding energy, film morphology, and photovoltaic device performance. We use density functional theory to compute the equilibrium structures, band structures, carrier effective masses, and phase stability diagrams. We find the A-site cation governs the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Cs3Sb2I9 has a 0D structure, the largest exciton binding energy (175 ± 9 meV), an indirect bandgap, and, in a solar cell, low photocurrent (0.13 mA cm–2). Rb3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, a direct bandgap, and, among the materials investigated, the lowest exciton binding energy (101 ± 6 meV) and highest photocurrent (1.67 mA cm–2). K3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, intermediate exciton binding energies (129 ± 9 meV), and intermediate photocurrents (0.41 mA cm–2). Despite remarkably long lifetimes in all compounds (54, 9, and 30 ns for Cs-, Rb-, and K-based materials, respectively), low photocurrents limit performance of all devices. We conclude that carrier collection is limited by large exciton binding energies (experimentally observed) and large carrier effective masses (calculated from density functional theory). The highest photocurrent and efficiency (0.76%) were observed in the Rb-based compound with a direct bandgap, relatively lower exciton binding energy, and lower calculated electron effective mass. To reliably screen for candidate lead-free photovoltaic absorbers, we advise that faster and more accurate computational tools are needed to calculate exciton binding energies and effective masses."
"We demonstrate a novel one-step solution approach to prepare perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films by adding CH3NH3Cl (or MACl) to the standard CH3NH3PbI3 precursor (equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2) solution. The use of MACl strongly affects the crystallization process of forming pure CH3NH3PbI3, leading not only to enhanced absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 but also to significantly improved coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 on a planar substrate. Compared to the standard one-step solution approach for CH3NH3PbI3, using MACl improves the performance of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells from about 2% to 12% for the planar cell structure and from about 8% to 10% for the mesostructured device architecture. Although we find no significant effect of using MACl on charge transport and recombination in mesostructured perovskite cells, the recombination resistance for planar cells increases by 1–2 orders of magnitude by using MACl. These results suggest that this new one-step solution approach is promising for controlling CH3NH3PbI3 growth to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells."
"Methylammonium bismuth iodide ((CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, MBI) is a promising alternative to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its air stability and low-toxicity. Herein, a two-stage electric-field-assisted reactive deposition method has been introduced to prepare MBI films for the first time. PSCs based on MBI films were fabricated and characterized. The influences of electric parameters (applied voltage mode, pulse and time, etc.) on the morphology and crystal structure of MBI film correlated with the photovoltaic performance of PSCs have also been investigated systematically in detail. Through adjusting the voltage mode, crystal growth can be completely controlled, leading to a compact MBI film with large grain size. Moreover, the MBI film prepared by electrochemical deposition required no annealing. This work determined that the optimal performance of PSCs is based on the MBI film deposited by square-wave (AC) voltage mode (−7.3 V/+1 V, 5 Hz, 5 min). All devices exhibited long-term stability in ambient air (humidity of >50%) for more than 300 h. This study will inspire further research on the application of electrochemical deposition technique for other lead-free PSCs."
"The high cost of hole transporting materials (HTMs) and noble metal electrodes limits the application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Carbon materials have been commonly utilized for HTMs and noble-metal-free PSCs. In this paper, a more conductive 2D MXene material (Ti3C2), showing a similar energy level to carbon materials, has been used as a back electrode in HTMs and noble-metal-free PSCs for the first time. Seamless interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and Ti3C2 material was obtained using a simple hot-pressing method. After the adjustment of key parameters, the PSCs based on the Ti3C2 electrode show more stability and higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) (13.83%, 27% higher than that (10.87%) of the PSCs based on carbon electrodes) due to the higher conductivity and seamless interfacial contact of the MXene electrode. Our work proposes a promising future application for MXene and also a good electrode candidate for HTM and the noble-metal-free PSCs"
"Conventional materials for gas/vapor sensing are limited to a single probe detection ability for specific analytes. However, materials capable of concurrent detection of two different probes in their respective harmful levels and using two types of sensing modes have yet to be explored. In particular, the concurrent detection of uncomfortable humidity levels and CO2 concentration (400–5000 ppm) in confined spaces is of extreme importance in a great variety of fields, such as submarine technology, aerospace, mining, and rescue operations. Herein, we report the deliberate construction and performance assessment of extremely sensitive sensors using an interdigitated electrode (IDE)-based capacitor and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as transducing substrates. The unveiled sensors are able to simultaneously detect CO2 within the 400–5000 ppm range and relative humidity levels below 40 and above 60%, using two fluorinated metal–organic frameworks, namely, NbOFFIVE-1-Ni and AlFFIVE-1-Ni, fabricated as a thin film. Their subtle difference in a structure–adsorption relationship for H2O and CO2 was analyzed to unveil the corresponding structure–sensing property relationships using both QCM- and IDE-based sensing modes."
"Forming a 2D capping layer has been recognized as an effective strategy to improve both efficiency and stability of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells. However, constructing a 2D/3D heterostructure is difficult for inorganic perovskites due to their resistance to cation exchange reaction. Here, we report an effective in situ growth method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure for inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. The 2D capping layer was found to form a type-II heterojunction with 3D perovskites, facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/hole transport layer interface. When exposed to a humid environment, the 2D/3D perovskite films showed greatly enhanced phase stability as compared to the pristine 3D perovskite films. As a result, the optimized 2D/3D CsPbI2Br device reached a power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with improved short-circuit current and significantly enhanced device moisture stability."
"In this report, we demonstrate that moisture/O2 in ambient air is the major issue for the photovoltaic performance degradation and severe photocurrent hysteresis of non-encapsulated planar-perovskite solar cells. Consequently, this leads to difficulty in determining the real power conversion efficiency (PCE). Upon longer storage time, the evidence of a small amount of iodine in the hole transport layer (HTL) led to hindering the charge transport from the HTL to the anode, thus resulting in the decrease of short-circuit current density and fill factor. Meanwhile, the transient chronoamperometry result suggests that the increase of hysteresis with storage time is ascribed to the changes of activation energy. It is further supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile analysis, which revealed that penetration of moisture/O2 caused the shifts of iodine distribution within the perovskite layer after aging time of >72 h. Remarkably, effective moisture/O2 passivation can be achieved by combination of polyimide and UV-cured polymer as a novel encapsulation process, which exhibited an impressive stabilized PCE of above 14% (retained 97% of its initial efficiency) and simultaneously maintained the hysteresis up to ∼1000 h."
"One-step solution process is a facile and widely used procedure to prepare organic–inorganic perovskite materials. However, the poor surface morphology of the films attributed to the uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth in the process is unfavorable to solar cells. In this study, an anti-solvent treatment during the one-step solution process, in which ethyl acetate (EA) was dropped on the sample during spinning the precursor solution containing CH3NH3Cl, was adopted to fabricate perovskite materials and solar cells. It was found that the morphology of the perovskite film was significantly improved due to the rapid nucleation and slow crystal growth process. The modified process enabled us to fabricate the mesoporous solar cell with power conversion efficiency of 14%, showing an improvement of 40% over the efficiency of 9.7% of the device prepared by conventional one-step method. The controlling effect of annealing time on the morphology, crystal structure and transport properties of perovskite layer as well as the performance of device fabricated by the anti-solvent method were investigated and the possible mechanism was discussed."
"Low-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (LDRP) perovskites are a current theme in solar energy research as researchers attempt to fabricate stable photovoltaic devices from them. However, poor exciton dissociation and insufficiently fast charge transfer slows the charge extraction in these devices, resulting in inferior performance. 1,4-Butanediamine (BEA)-based low-dimensional perovskites are designed to improve the carrier extraction efficiency in such devices. Structural characterization using single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that these layered perovskites are formed by the alternating ordering of diammonium (BEA2+) and monoammonium (MA+) cations in the interlayer space (B-ACI) with the formula (BEA)0.5MAn PbnI3n+1. Compared to the typical LDRP counterparts, these B-ACI perovskites deliver a wider light absorption window and lower exciton binding energies with a more stable layered perovskite structure. Additionally, ultrafast transient absorption indicates that B-ACI perovskites exhibit a narrow distribution of quantum well widths, leading to a barrier-free and balanced carrier transport pathway with enhanced carrier diffusion (electron and hole) length over 350 nm. A perovskite solar cell incorporating BEA ligands achieves record efficiencies of 14.86% for (BEA)0.5MA3Pb3I10 and 17.39% for (BEA)0.5Cs0.15(FA0.83MA0.17)2.85Pb3(I0.83Br0.17)10 without hysteresis. Furthermore, the triple cations B-ACI devices can retain over 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency when stored under ambient atmospheric conditions for 2400 h and show no significant degradation under constant illumination for over 500 h."
"Over the past several years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have developed rapidly. One of the hot topics with perovskite solar cells is how to achieve a high quality perovskite thin film. A Lewis acid–base adduct is effective for controlling perovskite morphology during the film preparation process. Zinc ion (Zn2+) is a stronger Lewis acid than lead ion (Pb2+) and it has a high ability to coordinate with methylamine groups (CH3NH3+), so it is doped into perovskite precursors to substitute for Pb2+ to influence crystallization during the annealing process. In this work, by adjusting zinc ions concentration, high quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer pinholes were obtained. Finally, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on optimal concentration reached to 16.3% (with an open circuit voltage of 1.06 V, short circuit current density of 21.98 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 70%), resulting in a 34.7% improvement compared to a pristine one. Our work highlights the metal-ion additive as an effective method to control perovskite film quality."
"Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed a rapid rising in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the past few years; however, they still suffer from recombination loss via interface defects in perovskite films. In this study, we implement an efficient phase purification strategy by incorporating isopropyl alcohol (IPA) post-treatment of perovskite films that reduces defect states and improves charge transport. It is found that the DMSO-PbI2-MAI complex in the perovskite film is eliminated after IPA post-treatment. A suit of opto-electric characterizations demonstrates that the nonradiative recombination is greatly diminished, and charge extraction is effectively boosted in the modified perovskite films. The perovskite solar cells with phase-pure MAPbI3 achieve an impressively larger PCE of 18.78% than that of 17.1% for the control devices. Our work presents a facile and efficient path to performance improvement of PSCs."
"Methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (MAPbX3, where MA is methylammonium, and X is a halide)-based solar cells have been intensively investigated recently,1 with the demonstrated certified solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20%.2 To further boost the PCE to beyond the Schockley–Queisser limit,3 tandem structured solar cells have been investigated based on integrating MAPbX3 and low bandgap solar cells.4-8 However, the efficiency of the two-terminal integrated perovskite-silicon tandem cells is still low. The best reported efficiency of 13.7% for this type of tandem cells is far smaller than the individual cells yet, partially due to the limited performance of the mixed-halide perovskite MAPbBrxI3–x solar cell employed in this structure.5 The mixed-halide perovskite MAPbBrxI3–x is still one of the most promising candidates as the wide-bandgap light absorber for the tandem application to match the bandgap of silicon, considering its continuously tunable bandgap from 1.6 eV to 2.3 eV with different bromide incorporation ratio.7, 9, 10 However, the application of MAPbBrxI3–x based solar cells has been reported to confront with one big challenge of intrinsic light instability.11 The MAPbBrxI3–x materials on mesoporous scaffold were shown to be unstable under illumination with a photo-excited phase-separation into two phases, one iodine-rich phase and one iodine-poor phase.11, 12 The lower bandgap phase thus acts as the charge traps, which was hypothesized to be responsible to the severely reduced device open circuit voltage and device PCE for the mixed-halide perovskite devices"
"Two synthetic chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives named Zn-Chl and H2-Chl are examined as efficient hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). The device structure here is ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl/H2-Chl/Ag, which employs Zn-Chl/H2-Chl as the bilayer HTL. Zn-Chl and H2-Chl show different electronic absorptions, surface morphology, hole mobilities and energy levels due to their structural differences. The bilayer HTL realizes complementary performance of the Chl in each layer. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) reaches 14.1% under standard AM1.5 illumination, which is higher than that of the device with monolayer Zn-Chl (11.9%) or H2-Chl (0.16%) only. The bilayer HTL also exhibits better device stability. This is the first time that bilayer Chl has been used as a HTL in PSCs. It provides a promising method to enhance the performance of Chl-based PSCs."
"Herein, we demonstrate a novel two-terminal perovskite/silicon mechanical tandem solar cell, fabricated by bonding a silicon cell upside down on a perovskite cell using a transparent conductive adhesive (TCA). The TCA consists of Ag-coated poly(methyl 2-methylpropenoate) microparticles embedded in a polymer adhesive. The Ag microparticles serve as an electrical current path, and the polymer adhesive mechanically bonds two sub-cells. The specific contact resistance and transmittance of the TCA layer were determined to be 5.46 × 10−2 Ω∙cm2 and >97.0%, respectively. Through an optical simulation, the current of the perovskite top cell was predicted to match the current of the p-type Si bottom cell with an Al back-surface field (BSF) layer when the thickness of MAPbI3 was 150 nm. The tandem cell fabricated under the optimal current matching conditions exhibited a current density of 15.43 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V, and a fill factor of 79%, resulting in a steady-state efficiency of 19.4%. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the highest efficiency among two-terminal mechanical perovskite/silicon tandem cells. The unique structure of this tandem cell facilitates an excellent long-term stability without encapsulation in humid environment."
An effective approach to significantly increase the electrical conductivity of a NiOx hole-transporting layer (HTL) to achieve high-efficiency planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. Perovskite solar cells based on using Cu-doped NiOx HTL show a remarkably improved power conversion efficiency up to 15.40% due to the improved electrical conductivity and enhanced perovskite film quality. General applicability of Cu-doped NiOx to larger bandgap perovskites is also demonstrated in this study
"A room-temperature solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule material, termed C3, has been designed, synthesized, and incorporated between a conventional PCBM electron transport layer (ETL) and a metal electrode to function as a single-layer cathode buffer layer (CBL) for efficient planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). It has been found that C3 has a work function tunneling effect, which can decrease the work function of the Ag electrode; therefore, introduction of C3 successfully enhances the interface contact and reduces the interface barriers, which usually exist between fullerene derivatives and metal electrodes. It was also found that the C3 capping layer could improve the surface quality of PCBM, forming a smooth, dense and pinhole-free morphology with fewer surface defects. Thus, C3 can modify the interface between PCBM and Ag, enhance the diode properties of devices and facilitate electron transport through the devices; therefore, it is a very promising CBL material for PVSCs. A device with a hybrid PCBM ETL and a single cathode buffer layer of C3 exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.42% with negligible hysteresis, which was dramatically higher than that of a device based on a pure PCBM ETL. With the major advantages of a low-temperature solution process and interface modification, the excellent PCE of PVSCs on flexible substrates can exceed 13%. These results demonstrate that solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule materials can serve as high performance CBLs in PVSCs."
"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising solar energy conversion technologies owing to their rapidly developing power conversion efficiency (PCE). Low-temperature solution processing of the perovskite layer enables the fabrication of flexible devices. However, their application has been greatly hindered due to the lack of strategies to fabricate high-quality electron transport layers (ETLs) at the low temperatures (≈100 °C) that most flexible plastic substrates can withstand, leading to poor performances for flexible PSCs. In this work, through combining the spin-coating process with a hydrothermal treatment method, ligand-free and highly crystalline SnO2 ETLs are successfully fabricated at low temperature. The flexible PSCs based on this SnO2 ETL exhibit an excellent PCE of 18.1% (certified 17.3%). The flexible PSCs maintained 85% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles and over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient air for 30 days without encapsulation. The investigation reveals that hydrothermal treatment not only promotes the complete removal of organic surfactants coated onto the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles by hot water vapor but also enhances crystallization through the high vapor pressure of water, leading to the formation of high-quality SnO2 ETLs"
"Sn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) featuring high performance and long-term stability are very challenging because Sn2+ is relatively prone to oxidation. Here, we have performed coadditive engineering with 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) for FASnI3-based perovskite films. From the morphological, structural, and elemental analyses, we observed that 5-AVAI affects the crystal growth of perovskites through its hydrogen bond with I– of the SnI64– octahedral. As a result, pinhole-free homogeneous and stable Sn-based perovskite films form over a large area with lower Sn4+ content. This made us able to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for Sn-based PSCs up to 7% in a 0.25 cm2 aperture area. Most importantly, the 5-AVAI added PSCs showed a record stability and maintained their initial PCE under 1 sun continuous illumination at maximum power point tracking for 100 h."
"One of key factors to design applicable electron transport layers (ETLs) for perovskite solar cells is the morphology of ETLs since a good morphology would help to facilitate the carrier transport at two interfaces (perovskite\ETL and ETL\cathode). However, one drawback of most organic ETL small molecules is the internal undesired accumulation, which would cause the formation of inappropriate morphology and rough ETL surface. Here, by elaborately designing the side chains of NDI derivatives, the molecular interaction could be modified to achieve the aggregation in different degrees, which would eventually affect the accumulation of molecules and surface qualities of ETLs. By speculating from the comparison between the absorption spectra of solutions and films, the sequence of extent of molecule interaction and aggregation was built among three NDI derivatives, which is further confirmed by direct evidence of atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. Then, carrier exaction abilities are simply studied by steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. The carrier transport process is also discussed based on cyclic voltammetry, time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and mobility. NDIF1 are proven to have the appropriate internal aggregation to smooth the contact with cathode and low series resistance, and a device performance of 15.6 % is achieved. With the ability of preventing the thermal diffusion of Ag towards the perovskite surface due to the strong interaction between molecules, NDIF2 at high concentration shows the highest fill factor (80 %)"
"Even though the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of plastic perovskite solar cells (P-PSCs) is increased to 18.40%, the majority of solvent systems implemented for deposition of perovskites are hazardous to handle, which will greatly hinder the future development of plastic photovoltaic devices. In this study, composition-tailored hybrid perovskite from a low-toxicity aqueous lead nitrate precursor was fabricated by regulating the conversion kinetics. We systematically investigated the interplay among NO3− and mixed cation/anion in the intermediate ion exchange and renovated the interpretation of hybrid-composition perovskite conversion. The fully ambient-processed hybrid-composition perovskite with high crystallinity and less defects was applied in a brookite TiO2 scaffold-based P-PSCs, which achieved a record-high PCE of scaffold-type P-PSC of 16.50%. The interaction of environmentally-friendly aqueous lead nitrate precursor with hybrid ions advanced the understanding of perovskite conversion mechanism and had a great potential to realize the low-toxic fabrication process by using water as a processing solvent in the ambient atmosphere."
"Anomalous current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in perovskite (PSK) solar cell is open to dispute, where hysteresis is argued to be due to electrode polarization, dipolar polarization, and/or native defects. However, a correlation between those factors and J–V hysteresis is hard to be directly evaluated because they usually coexist and are significantly varied depending on morphology and crystallinity of the PSK layer, selective contacts, and device architecture. In this study, without changing morphology and crystallinity of PSK layer in a planar heterojunction structure employing FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3, a correlation between J–V hysteresis and trap density is directly evaluated by means of thermally induced PbI2 regulating trap density. Increase in thermal annealing time at a given temperature of 150 °C induces growth of PbI2 on the PSK grain surface, which results in significant reduction of nonradiative recombination. Hysteresis index is reduced from 0.384 to 0.146 as the annealing time is increased from 5 to 100 min due to decrease in the amplitude of trap-mediated recombination. Reduction of hysteresis by minimizing trap density via controlling thermal annealing time leads to the stabilized PCE of 18.84% from the normal planar structured FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 PSK solar cell."
"Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type 2D perovskites with a single organic cation layer exhibit a narrower distance between two adjacent inorganic layers compared to the corresponding Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites, which facilitates interlayer charge transport. However, the internal crystal structures in 2D DJ perovskites remain elusive. Herein, in a p-xylylenediamine (PDMA)-based DJ perovskite bearing bifunctional NH3+ spacer, the compression from confinement structure (inorganic layer number, n = 1, 2) to nonconfinement structure (n > 3) with the decrease of PDMA molar ratio is unraveled. Remarkably, the nonconfined perovskite displays shorter spacing between 2D quantum wells, which results in a lower exciton binding energy and hence promotes exciton dissociation. The significantly diminishing quantum confinement promotes interlayer charge transport leading to a maximum photovoltaic efficiency of ≈11%. Additionally, the tighter interlayer packing arising from the squeezing of inorganic octahedra gives rise to enhanced ambient stability."
"Inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 has been studied as a promising alternative light-absorbing material for photovoltaic application due to its suitable band gap for converting solar light and enhanced stability toward ambient conditions compared to the organic–inorganic halide perovskite. However, the photoactive α-phase of CsPbI3 can only be stabilized at a high temperature and the phase transition from α-phase to δ-phase easily occurs at room temperature. Herein, ytterbium (III) chloride (YbCl3) as a bifunctional additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to stabilize the black α-phase, and high-quality CsPbI3 films are obtained at a temperature as low as 80 °C. Yb3+ partly replaces Pb2+ to enhance the tolerance factor and favors the formation of α-phase. The Lewis adduct complex of YbCl3·DMSO in the perovskite film can passivate the perovskite film with reduced defects and help enhance the stability of the α-phase. The YbCl3-modified planar-type α-CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells show a champion power conversion efficiency of 12.4% with an impressive stability at ambient conditions. The additive induced controlled crystallization provides a simple and promising way to improve the photovoltaic performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells."
"To enhance the light harvesting capability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), TiO2 nanoparticles/nanotubes (TNNs) were incorporated into the active layer of PSCs. The TNN-containing cells showed a substantial increase in photocurrent density (JSC), from 23.9 mA/cm2 without nanotubes to 25.5 mA/cm2, suggesting that the TiO2 nanotubes enhanced the charge conduction and harvested more sunlight, which was attributed to the Mie scattering effect. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TiO2 nanoparticles in the active layer (14.16%), the TNN-containing cells with optimal loading of 9 wt % TiO2 nanotubes showed a high PCE of 15.34%. "
"Minimization of defects and ion migration in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite films is desirable for obtaining photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability. However, achieving this target is still a challenge due to the lack of efficient multifunctional passivators. Herein, to address this issue, n-type goethite (FeOOH) quantum dots (QDs) are introduced into the perovskite light-absorption layer for achieving efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It is found that the iron, oxygen, and hydroxyl of FeOOH QDs can interact with iodine, lead, and methylamine, respectively. As a result, the crystallization kinetics process can be retarded, thereby resulting in high quality perovskite films with large grain size. Meanwhile, the trap states of perovskite can be effectively passivated via interaction with the under-coordinated metal (Pb) cations, halide (I) anions on the perovskite crystal surface. Consequently, the PSCs with FeOOH QDs achieve a high efficiency close to 20% with negligible hysteresis. Most strikingly, the long-term stability of PSCs is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, compared with the CH3NH3PbI3-based device, a higher PCE of 21.0% is achieved for the device assembled with a Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbBr0.45I2.55 perovskite layer"
"High efficiency for H2 production: a single perovskite solar cell is demonstrated to drive three reformed electrolyzers in series for hydrogen production by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction at anode with the hydrazine oxidation reaction. Furthermore, careful matching of the operating point of the reformed electrolysis cell with the maximum power point of photovoltaic device results in an impressively high solar-to-fuel efficiency. "
"Due to a wide range of intriguing properties, such as efficient one-dimensional (1D) electron pathways and extraordinarily large surface areas, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube arrays are considered as the promising electron transport material for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to directly synthesize the TiO2 nanotube arrays with well-controlled geometries (e.g., diameter and height, etc.) on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Here, vertically standing TiO2 nanotube arrays with desirable heights and diameters are directly synthesized on the FTO surface by employing the aqueous TiO2 sol-gel method on tubular photoresist templates. The tube height can be precisely tailored within a range of 350–900 nm for the effective loading of perovskite precursor solution. Importantly, it is demonstrated that TiO2 nanotube arrays with the optimized tube diameter and length can facilitate the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution, and thus ensuring the formation of a dense, smooth and large grain-sized perovskite film. Moreover, the contact between the perovskite and TiO2 nanotube arrays are enhanced simultaneously. Benefiting from the high-quality perovskite film, good interfacial contact at the perovskite/TiO2 tube interface, enhanced light trapping as well as rapid electron collection and transport induced by one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes, the fabricated PVSCs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14.13%. Our work does not only demonstrate the promising potential of vertical TiO2 nanotube arrays for PVSCs, but also provides valuable insights into the design and utilization of TiO2 nanotubes for practical applications."
This study successfully demonstrates the application of inorganic p-type nickel oxide (NiOx ) as electrode interlayer for the fabrication of NiOx /CH3 NH3 PbI3 perovskite/PCBM PHJ hybrid solar cells with a respectable solar-to-electrical PCE of 7.8%. The better energy level alignment and improved wetting of the NiOx electrode interlayer significantly enhance the overall photovoltaic performance. 
"Two hole-extraction materials (HEMs), TPP-OMeTAD and TPP-SMeTAD, have been developed to facilitate the fabrication of efficient p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). By replacing the oxygen atom on HEM with sulfur (from TPP-OMeTAD to TPP-SMeTAD), it effectively lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital of the molecule and provides stronger PbS interaction with perovskites, leading to efficient charge extraction and surface traps passivation. The TPP-SMeTAD-based PVSCs exhibit both improved photovoltaic performance and reduced hysteresis in p-i-n PVSCs over those based on TPP-OMeTAD. This work not only provides new insights on creating perovskite-HEM heterojunction but also helps in designing new HEM to enable efficient organic–inorganic hybrid PVSCs."
"Standard layer-by-layer solution processing methods constrain lead–halide perovskite device architectures. The layer below the perovskite must be robust to the strong organic solvents used to form the perovskite while the layer above has a limited thermal budget and must be processed in nonpolar solvents to prevent perovskite degradation. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminesence spectroscopy, we show that this procedure improves photovoltaic properties of the perovskite layer. Applying this procedure, semitransparent devices employing two high-temperature oxide transport layers were fabricated, which realized an average efficiency of 9.6% (maximum: 10.6%) despite series resistance limitations from the substrate design. Overall, the developed lamination procedure curtails processing constraints, enables new device designs, and affords new opportunities for optimization."
"Self-powered electrofluorochromic devices (EFCDs) have attracted particular attention for smart windows of green buildings. In this work, we report a perovskite solar cell (PSC) driven self-powered EFCD. For the first time, electrochromic material polyoxometalates (POMs) and a fluorescent component are made into wet adhesives. A special design feature is that POMs and magnesium composed a battery powering the EFCD bleaching, and the device can be quickly coloured after connecting with the PSCs by the electrical power generated through solar energy conversion. Therefore, without any additional external bias, the fabricated EFCD undergoes an electrochromic transition from white semitransparent to dark blue-tinted, and under UV it presents reversible fluorescence switching between yellow and dark."
"Metal-halide based perovskite solar cells have rapidly emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic and thin-film photovoltaics. Although charge transport layers are used on either side of perovskite absorber layers to extract photogenerated electrons and holes, the time scales for charge extraction and recombination are poorly understood. Ideal charge transport layers should facilitate large discrepancies between charge extraction and recombination rates. Here, we demonstrate that highly enriched semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films enable rapid (sub-picosecond) hole extraction from a prototypical perovskite absorber layer and extremely slow back-transfer and recombination (hundreds of microseconds). The energetically narrow and distinct spectroscopic signatures for charges within these SWCNT thin films enables the unambiguous temporal tracking of each charge carrier with time-resolved spectroscopies covering many decades of time. The efficient hole extraction by the SWCNT layer also improves electron extraction by the compact titanium dioxide electron transport layer, which should reduce charge accumulation at each critical interface. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of thin interface layers of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes between the perovskite absorber layer and a prototypical hole transport layer improves device efficiency and stability, and reduces hysteresis."
"Hybrid organic and inorganic perovskite solar cells lack long-term stability, and this negatively impacts the widespread application of this emerging and promising photovoltaic technology. Herein, aiming to increase the stability of perovskite films based on CH3NH3PbI3 and to deeply understand the formation of 2D structures, solutions of alkylammonium chlorides containing 8, 10, and 12 carbons are introduced during the spin-coating on the surface of 3D perovskite films leading to the in situ formation of 2D structures. It is possible to identify the chemical formulae of some 2D structures formed by X-ray diffraction and UV–vis analysis of the modified films. Interestingly, the increase in the stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 films due to the formation of a 2D + 3D perovskite network is only possible in planar TiO2 substrates. The increase in stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 films follows the surfactant molecule order: octylammonium (8C) > decylammonium (1 °C) > dodecylammonium (12C) chlorides > standard. An increase of 17.6% in the lifetime of the devices assembled with octylammonium-modified perovskite film is observed compared with that of the standard device, which is directly linked to the improvement of the charge carrier lifetimes obtained from time-correlated single photon counting measurements."
"All-inorganic CsPbBr3 is attracting tremendous attentions in photovoltaic field due to its superior stability. However, CsPbBr3 perovskite always suffers from a poor crystallinity and film morphology. Many efforts have been paid on the CsBr deposition process to improve the film quality, while few attentions are paid on the crystallization kinetics of the PbBr2 framework film. Here, we demonstrate a novel antisolvent-washing strategy for the PbBr2 film for the first time to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 film. This technique has a significant impact on the nucleation and growth of PbBr2 crystals. As-prepared CsPbBr3 films exhibit more homogeneous with higher crystallinity and coverage as well as larger grain sizes compared to those untreated ones. The best-performing antisolvent-treated perovskite solar cell achieves a scanned power conversion efficiency of 8.55%, which is an excellent efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 cells reported yet. This enhancement can be mainly attributed to the more effective charge transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination caused by the reduced defect densities. Moreover, our devices show superb stability when stored in air for 1000 h and upon persistent thermal attack at 80 °C. Our work provides a new train of thought for controlling the growth dynamics and film morphology of CsPbBr3 films."
"Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting great attention. A conjugated organic molecule, bathocuproine (BCP), is often deposited on C60 for electron collection in inverted PSCs. But organic molecules are not stable against UV light and cannot act as good barrier layers to protect the perovskite layer. In principle, inorganic materials can have better stability, but the thermal deposition of inorganic materials usually requires very high temperature. In this work, zinc selenide (ZnSe), a two-dimensional (2D) II–VI semiconductor material with a wide bandgap and high electron mobility, is investigated for electron collection in PSCs without BCP. The ZnSe layer is deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. The PSCs with ZnSe can exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.38%, comparable to that with BCP. In addition, the former has better stability than the latter. We also demonstrate PSCs with inorganic materials for both hole and electron collection."
"The ability to process amorphous or polycrystalline solar cells at low temperature (<150 °C) opens many possibilities for substrate choice and monolithic multijunction solar cell fabrication. Organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells have evolved rapidly over the last two years, and the CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, I or Br) material is processed at low temperature. However the first embodiments of the solar cell were composed of high temperature processed (500 °C) compact and mesoporous layers of TiO2. The sintering of the mesoporous TiO2 has been negated by replacing this with a mesoporous insulating scaffold in the meso-superstructured solar cell (MSSC), yet the high temperature processed compact TiO2 layer still persists in the most efficient devices. Here we have realised a low temperature route for compact TiO2, tailored for perovskite MSSC operation. With our optimized formulation we demonstrate full sun solar power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.9% in an all low temperature processed solar cell."
"Optimal optoelectronic properties of interfacial layers in perovskite solar cells are essential for achieving high power conversion efficiency. We herein demonstrated a solution-processed spinel CuCo2O4 as a hole transport layer to use in high-performance perovskite solar cells. The solution-processed CuCo2O4 possessed high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency in UV–vis–NIR, well-matched energy levels to perovskite, and efficient hole transport capability to the perovskite layer. The optoelectronic properties of CuCo2O4 were finely controlled by optimizing the annealing temperature, leading to a 14.12% power conversion efficiency in planar perovskite solar cells. Another impressive advantage for the CuCo2O4-based hole transport layer is a negligible hysteresis of the device at very low scan rate, which brought about highly stable and reliable photovoltaic performance. All of the results studied in this work suggest a bright future for solution-processed CuCo2O4 as a novel hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and good stability."
