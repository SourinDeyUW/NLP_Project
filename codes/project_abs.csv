0,"In the present study, Er and Yb co-doped TiO2 (Er-Yb:TiO2) nanorod arrays were grown with a hydrothermal method, and perovskite solar cells were fabricated using them as an electron transfer material. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on Er-Yb:TiO2 was enhanced compared with that of solar cells based on un-doped TiO2. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cells on Er-Yb:TiO2 increased to 13.4%, which is 20.8% higher than that of the solar cells based on un-doped TiO2. The experimental results indicate that the larger open circuit voltage could be due to the larger conduction band difference between Er-Yb:TiO2 and perovskite material. The enlarged short circuit current could be attributed to the faster electron transfer, reduced recombination, and the upconversion of Er-Yb:TiO2 NRs."
1,"An important property of hybrid layered perovskite is the possibility to reduce its dimensionality to provide wider band gap and better stability. In this work, 2D perovskite of the structure (PEA)2(MA)n–1PbnBr3n+1 has been sensitized, where PEA is phenyl ethyl-ammonium, MA is methyl-ammonium, and using only bromide as the halide. The number of the perovskite layers has been varied (n) from n = 1 through n = ∞. Optical and physical characterization verify the layered structure and the increase in the band gap. The photovoltaic performance shows higher open circuit voltage (Voc) for the quasi 2D perovskite (i.e., n = 40, 50, 60) compared to the 3D perovskite. Voc of 1.3 V without hole transport material (HTM) and Voc of 1.46 V using HTM have been demonstrated, with corresponding efficiency of 6.3% and 8.5%, among the highest reported. The lower mobility and transport in the quasi 2D perovskites have been proved effective to gain high Voc with high efficiency, further supported by ab initio calculations and charge extraction measurements. Bromide is the only halide used in these quasi 2D perovskites, as mixing halides have recently revealed instability of the perovskite structure. These quasi 2D materials are promising candidates for use in optoelectronic applications that simultaneously require high voltage and high efficiency."
2,"The strategy of sequentially spin-coating a perovskite film from the perovskite precursor and an electron transporting layer of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is developed to simplify the fabrication procedure of perovskite solar cells. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy indicate that PC71BM film on perovskite layer can retard the evaporation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) efficiently, thus prolonging the transformation of intermediate phase to perovskite crystals, leading to a high quality perovskite thin film. The solar cells with the structure of indium tin oxides (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag made from this simplified method exhibit a higher efficiency (12.68%) than those from the conventional one-step method (9.49%)."
3,"Hybrid lead halide perovskites (PVKs) have emerged as novel materials for photovoltaics and have rapidly reached very large solar to electricity power conversion efficiencies. As occurring with other kind of solar technologies establishing the working energy-band diagram constitutes a primary goal for device physics analysis. Here, the macroscopic electrical field distribution is experimentally determined using capacitance-voltage and Kelvin probe techniques. Planar structures comprising CH3NH3PbI3−xClx PVK exhibit p-doping character and form a p-n heterojunction with n-doped TiO2 compact layers. Depletion width at equilibrium within the PVK bulk has an extent about 300 nm (approximately half of the layer thickness), leaving as a consequence a significant neutral zone towards the anode contact. Charge collection properties are then accessible relying on the relative weight that diffusion and drift have as carrier transport driven forces."
4,"Sn-doped TiO2 films were successfully deposited by low-temperature solution method as electron transport layer (ETL), whose influence on the performance of perovskite solar cell (PSC) was investigated. In this work, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed that Sn4+ was successfully incorporated into the TiO2 lattice as an effective metal ion dopant without forming secondary phases. Compared with pristine TiO2, the Sn-doped TiO2 is more efficient for photogenerated electron extraction and transport, showing lower trap-state density and higher conductivity. Higher short-circuit current (Jsc) is obtained due to the enhanced carrier transport velocity and improved charge collection efficiency, leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and better energy transfer efficiency. Our optimized planar solar cell using such a Sn-doped TiO2 ETL has achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2%, which was almost 29.3% higher than that of sample using the undoped TiO2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest processing temperature for Sn-dope TiO2 film at present, which provides an effective route towards flexible high-performance PSCs."
5,"Guanidinium (GA) has been proposed as an effective organic cation in improving the stability of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the reported efficiency of GA based PSCs is far behind traditional GA-free devices. Herein, a novel GA doped quadruple cation perovskite, Cs0.05(FA0.83(MA1−xGAx)0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (CsFAMA1−xGAx), is presented. It is found that the introduction of GA induces a phase separation of 3D CsFAMA1−xGAx, 2D FAGAPbI4, and 1D δ-FAPbI3. By tuning the content of GA, a δ-FAPbI3/CsFAMA1−xGAx (1D/3D) perovskite with superior optoelectronic properties is demonstrated. The novel 1D/3D perovskite shows an overall improvement in stability. The corresponding solar cell exhibits a PCE of 20.29% with negligible hysteresis, being the highest reported efficiency for GA based PSCs thus far. This study introduces a new perovskite model toward efficient and highly stable PSCs."
6,"Vacuum deposition techniques are used to prepare mixed iodide–bromide methylammonium lead perovskite diodes via an intermediate double layer of the pure iodide and bromide perovskites. The diodes lead to bright electroluminescence, whose emission spectra maxima shift from the infrared toward the visible with increasing bromide content. When illuminated with AM1.5 simulated sunlight the devices function as efficient solar cells with power conversion efficiencies as high as 12.9%."
7,"In this work, we develop a novel fluorinated small molecule BDT2FMeDPA, and further apply it as a dopant-free hole-transport material (HTM) for low-cost, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the vacuum-free carbon cathode. BDT2FMeDPA can be simply synthesized from commercial raw materials with a low-production cost. With the introduction of fluorine atoms in BDT2FMeDPA, the hole mobility and conductivity are significantly enhanced with an appropriate energy level alignment as compare with its non-fluorinated analogue (BDT0FMeDPA). The optimized PSC devices with pristine BDT2FMeDPA afford a decent power conversion efficiency of 14.5%, which is considerably higher than the devices using its non-fluorinated analogue (11.3%) under equivalent conditions. Moreover, the PSCs devices incorporating BDT2FMeDPA also show good long-term air stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 30 days under ambient atmosphere, due largely to its hydrophobic characteristic and the carbon cathode. The present work not only emphasizes that the performance of HTM can be effectively tuned through the introduction of fluorine atoms, but also provides insights into future design of dopant-free HTM for low-cost, stable and highly efficient PSCs."
8,"The presence of surface and grain boundary defects in organic–inorganic halide perovskite films can be detrimental to both the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the effect of chloride additives is studied on the bulk and surface defects of the mixed cation and halide PSCs. It is found that using an antisolvent technique, the perovskite film is divided into two layers, i.e., a bottom layer with large grains and a thin capping layer with small grains. The addition of formamidinium chloride (FACl) into the precursor solution removes the small-grained perovskite capping layer and suppresses the formation of bulk and surface defects, providing a perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and large grain size of over 1 µm. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show longer lifetimes for perovskite films modified by FACl and subsequently passivated by 1-adamantylamine hydrochloride as compared to the reference sample. Impedance spectroscopy measurements show that these treatments reduce the recombination in the PSCs, leading to a champion device with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.2%, an open circuit voltage of 1152 mV and negligible hysteresis. The Cl treated PSC also shows improved operational stability with only 12% PCE loss after 700 h under continuous illumination."

10,"The triple-cation mixed halide perovskite Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 emerges as one of the most promising candidates for photovoltaics due to superior optoelectronic properties, but the thermal stability is still a major challenge for the viability of perovskite solar cells towards commercialization. Herein, we firstly explore the thermal response of the photovoltaic performances to access device physical changes. It is shown that the efficiency loss originates from decreased charge mobility, increased trap density and generation of PbI2 charge recombination centers near the interface. In-depth analysis of evolutions in morphology, chemical composition, dynamic and electronic structure of the perovskite layer at the nanometer scales indicates that it is initial dangling bonds and vacancies on the imperfect surfaces decrease the activation energy and cause the perovskite decomposition in a layer-by-layer pathway sequentially from the film surface to bulk. Based on the results, a strategy of surface passivation to improve the thermal stability is demonstrated and discussed. This work for the first time provides insights into the physical and chemical change of such triple-cation perovskite and indicates that more effort should be invested in surface treatment for enhancing perovskite device stability"
11,"Long-term stability is crucial for the future application of perovskite solar cells, a promising low-cost photovoltaic technology that has rapidly advanced in the recent years. Here, we designed a nanostructured carbon layer to suppress the diffusion of ions/molecules within perovskite solar cells, an important degradation process in the device. Furthermore, this nanocarbon layer benefited the diffusion of electron charge carriers to enable a high-energy conversion efficiency. Finally, the efficiency on a perovskite solar cell with an aperture area of 1.02 cm2, after a thermal aging test at 85 °C for over 500 h, or light soaking for 1,000 h, was stable of over 15% during the entire test. The present diffusion engineering of ions/molecules and photo generated charges paves a way to realizing long-term stable and highly efficient perovskite solar cells."
12,"Perovskite solar cells have received worldwide interests due to swiftly improved efficiency but the poor stability of the perovskite component hampers the device fabrication under normal condition. Herein, we develop a reliable nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route to stable perovskite films by intermediate chemistry and technology. Perovskite thin-film prepared by nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route is stable for two months with negligible PbI2-impurity under ∼65% humidity, whereas other perovskites prepared by traditional methods degrade distinctly after 2 weeks. Route optimization involves the reaction of PbI2 with excess HI to generate HPbI3, which subsequently undergoes reaction with excess CH3NH2 to deliver CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. High quality of intermediate HPbI3 and CH3NH2 abundance are two important factors to stable CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Excess volatile acid/base not only affords full conversion in nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route but also permits its facile removal for stoichiometric purification, resulting in average efficiency of 16.1% in forward/reverse scans."
13,"All-inorganic perovskites have aroused great interest recently because of their prominent photoelectric properties and thermal stability for stable, highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Herein, a two-step multiple spin coating method has been developed for the first time to prepare cesium halide perovskite films. In particular, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is introduced into CsBr/methanol precursor solution to increase the solubility of CsBr; in the meantime, it can also remarkably influence the morphologies, optical properties and photovoltaic performance of CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (0 < x < 1) films. By regulating the content of DMSO, as high as 13.27% power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved with a steady-state PCE of 12.5% under optimal conditions, which can maintain 98% of the initial PCE for 480 h under ambient conditions without encapsulation. The synergistic effect of the solvent-engineering method can provide a new access for good quality all-inorganic perovskite thin films for high performance optoelectronic devices."
14,"The light soaking phenomenon, in chlorine-based mixed halide perovskite solar cells (PSC) with p-i-n configuration, is studied. Due to light soaking, the solar cells have shown improved open circuit voltage, fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency without much change in short circuit current. The devices have returned to their original state upon extended exposure to dark conditions. Capacitance spectroscopy is used to understand the effect of light soaking on various photovoltaic parameters. The observed increase of capacitance value with light soaking in the low frequency region of the capacitance-frequency (C–F) plot is elucidated, as the coupled effect of electronic and ionic processes involving defects. The decrement in the mid-frequency capacitance is attributed to an increase in the width of the depletion region which eventually facilitated the improvement in open circuit voltage and FF. Defect densities, and its distribution in the energy space, are deduced before and after light soaking. The defects density of states of PSC studied are found to reduce from 1016 to 1015 eV−1 cm−3, with a Gaussian distribution, and having a peak energy shift from 0.27 to 0.26 eV."
15,"Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on the hybrid organic/inorganic structure have shown great prospect to the development of low cost, flexible, lightweight, and simple processability. But there are still exist many problems that limit its further commercial applications, such as the low mobility of hole transporting layer (HTL) and the poor stability which caused by the external environment and internal degradation. In this work, we demonstrated that the mixed HTL with poly-TPD and PTAA can increase the performance of p-i-n PVSCs. By doping poly-TPD into PTAA, the devices with mixed HTL show significantly enhancement of short-circuit current and fill factor, with an optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained over 20% enhancement compared with the control devices with bare PTAA, and the best PCE reaches 14.6%. Detailed analysis shows that the performance enhancement can be explained to the improved perovskite grain size and the increased electron transfer of mixed HTL. As a result, by incorporating poly-TPD with PTAA as the HTL, it provides an effective approach to reach high performance p-i-n PVSCs. "
16,"Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is one of the most promising electron-transporting materials (ETMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the present study, an ultra-thin CdS layer was prepared as the ETL using N-methyl thiourea (NMT) and introduced into a planar PSC. This new CdS ETL effectively enhanced the current without sacrificing other parameters such as the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, resulting in superior photovoltaic performance."
17,"Organic–inorganic hybrid lead-based perovskite solar cells have already achieved high performance efficiency (∼20%). A major challenge with these cells, however, is their stability and environmental safety concerns due to the presence of lead. This article reports an effort to develop a new class of tin-based and air-stable molecular semiconducting iodosalts, for potential solar cell applications. The compounds are Cs2SnI6−xBrx for a range of x that provides the desired bandgaps from ∼1.3 eV to ∼2.9 eV with x < 3 being suitable for solar cell design. The Sn in this compound is in the 4+ oxidation state, and thus it is much more stable with respect to oxidation and more resistant to hydrolysis during processing and device operation. The focus of this article is on the detailed synthesis challenges in the solution processing of these compounds. A two-step solution synthesis method has been developed whereby during Step-1 a well-defined CsI crystalline film was formed for the appropriate chemical reaction with a solution of SnI during Step-2. By careful tuning of each step of the process and with the use of detailed structural, electrical and optical characterization as feedback, a series of Cs2SnI6−xBrx films were produced. The importance of having a stoichiometric compound for optimal performance of the material was revealed during solar cell fabrication. For the purpose of demonstrating a solar cell device assembly, a sandwich-type photochemical cell with an all solid state ionic conductor blended with inorganic materials and succinonitrile was employed for easy processing to obtain stable results. "
18,"We study the photoinduced degradation of hybrid organometal perovskite photovoltaics under illumination and ambient atmosphere using UV–vis absorption, atomic force microscopy, and device performance. We correlate the structural changes in the surface of the perovskite film with changes in the optical and electronic properties of the devices. The photodecomposition of the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite layer itself proceeds much more slowly than the photodegradation of the performance of devices with fullerene/bathocuproine/aluminum top contacts, indicating that the active layer alone is more stable than the interface with the electrodes in this geometry. The evolution of the perovskite active layer performance proceeded through several phases: (1) an initial improvement in device characteristics, (2) a plateau with very slow degradation, and (3) a catastrophic decline in material performance accompanied by marked changes in film morphology. The rapid increase in surface roughness of the active perovskite semiconductor associated with sudden failure also correlates with decreased absorption at the perovskite band edge and growth of a lead iodide absorption feature. We find that degradation requires both light and moisture, is accelerated at increased humidity, and scales linearly with light intensity, depending primarily on total photon dose."
19,"Replacement of lead in the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells invokes the need for non-toxic materials such as Sn. Although solution processed CsSnI3 has been demonstrated as a lead-free halide perovskite which can function as a light absorber with high photocurrent densities, the power conversion efficiencies were bottlenecked by low open circuit voltages. In this work, the open circuit voltages are modulated by chemical doping of CsSnI3 with Br leading to formation of CsSnI3-xBrx (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) perovskites. The beneficial effect of Br incorporation for Voc improvement is evident for CsSnI3 system even without the addition of SnF2. There is an evolution of the crystal structure of CsSnI3 from orthorhombic to cubic for CsSnBr3 accompanied by changes in its optical properties with a blue shift of the absorption and IPCE onset, as the Br– doping is increased. The Voc enhancement is attributed to the decrease in Sn vacancies which is reflected by the lower charge carrier densities of 1015 cm–3 and a high resistance to charge recombination in case of Br rich CsSnI3-xBrx perovskite. By the addition of SnF2 to CsSnI3-xBrx perovskite, the current densities are improved significantly."
20,"Here, a simple strategy using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) as a multifunctional additive was employed to globally modify the two-step deposition process of the perovskite film. Morphological, structural, and spectral analyses showed that the BMII additive could coordinate with PbI2 and thereby retarded the reaction of PbI2 and CH3NH3I through the ionic exchange process. Moreover, the residual BMII provided a liquid domain to promote the coarsening of the perovskite crystal during the thermal annealing process. Thus, the obtained MAPbI3 film preferred low PbI2 residue, high-quality crystallization, and large-grained microstructure. Using films prepared with BMII additives, the maximum power conversion efficiency of the solar cells was improved from 12.6% of the reference cell to 15.6%. The present study gives a reproductive and facile strategy toward high quality of perovskite thin films and efficient solar cells."
21,This article compares two methods of perovskite solar cells manufacturing process due to their resistance against moisture. Two sets of experimental perovskite samples were subjected to the study. Solar cells were exposed to increasing humidity in the climatic chamber. The results have shown that cells manufactured in a 15% relative humidity environment are more resistant to later external environmental influences. The reason is probably in a low moisture presence during the perovskite solar cell production process which contributes to increased resistance against later degradation effects of water molecules.
22,"For typical planar perovskite solar cell, an electron transporting layer (ETL) plays an important role in extracting electrons from a perovskite layer and blocking electron-hole recombination at the perovskite/conductive substrate interface. To date, TiO2 or ZnO ETLs are mainly adopted in both forms of film and nanostructure due to their ease of preparation. Nevertheless, the photoinstability of TiO2 and thermal instability of ZnO/perovskite interface remain the major challenges limiting their potential commercialization. Herein, we demonstrate an effective in situ template self-etching (iTSE) strategy to grow the novel hollow domed SnO2 nanotubes array with ZnO nanorods as sacrifice templates and the growth mechanism of such SnO2 nanotubes has been proposed based on a series of controllable experiments. Using such SnO2 nanotube as ETL for perovskite solar cell demonstrates a high photocurrent density of 15.9 mA/cm2 at a based-voltage of 760 mV, leading to a stable power conversion efficiency of 12.1% over 1000 s under the simulated AM 1.5G one sun illumination. This work highlights the importance of the ETL material selection and provides insights into achieving an ideal ETL/substrate homojunction to facilitate electron transporting."
23,"ZnO nanorods are a good candidate for replacing standard photoanodes, such as TiO2, in perovskite solar cells and in principle superseding the high performances already obtained. This is possible because ZnO nanorods have a fast electron transport rate due to their large surface area. An array of ZnO nanorods is grown by chemical bath deposition starting from Al-doped ZnO (AZO) used both as a seed layer and as an efficient transparent anode in the visible spectral range. In particular, in this work we fabricate methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite solar cells using glass/AZO/ZnO nanorods/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as the architecture. The growth of ZnO nanorods has been optimized by varying the precursor concentrations, growth time and solution temperature. All the fabrication process and photovoltaic characterizations have been carried out in ambient air and the devices have not been encapsulated. Power conversion efficiency as high as 7.0% has been obtained with a good stability over 20 d. This is the highest reported value to the best of our knowledge and it is a promising result for the development of perovskite solar cells based on ZnO nanorods and AZO."
24,"Advancing of the lead halide perovskite solar cells towards photovoltaic market demands large-scale devices of high-power conversion efficiency, high reproducibility and stability via low-cost fabrication technology, and in particular resistance to humid environment for long-time operation. Here we achieve uniform perovskite film based on a novel polymer-scaffold architecture via a mild-temperature process. These solar cells exhibit efficiency of up to ∼16% with small variation. The unencapsulated devices retain high output for up to 300 h in highly humid environment (70% relative humidity). Moreover, they show strong humidity resistant and self-healing behaviour, recovering rapidly after removing from water vapour. Not only the film can self-heal in this case, but the corresponding devices can present power conversion efficiency recovery after the water vapour is removed. Our work demonstrates the value of cheap, long chain and hygroscopic polymer scaffold in perovskite solar cells towards commercialization."
25,"Herein, solution-processed 2D Nb2O5(001) nanosheets (c-Nb2O5 NS) are prepared and combined with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron transport layer (ETL) for inverted inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). The PeSCs with a c-Nb2O5/PC61BM bilayer ETL yield a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.74%, remarkably outperforming the devices with only PC61BM (9.10%) and those with the state-of-the-art ZnO/C60 ETL (10.65%) prepared under the same conditions. More importantly, the nonencapsulated PeSCs with c-Nb2O5 exhibit a high thermal stability with only 20% PCE loss after 400 h thermal aging at 85 °C. Such an impressive performance and a high stability can be attributed to the introduction of c-Nb2O5(001) NS with favorable band levels, strong acid nature, and the small lattice fringe spacing along the large lateral (001) surface, which not only facilitate the electron transport, blocking the hole transport, but also contribute to defect passivation and retard the iodine ions diffusion toward the Ag electrode. This study thus provides a deeper insight for the interfacial design in inverted inorganic PeSCs and contributes to PCE improvement in the future."
26,"A perovskite material CsAg2Sb2I9 was developed by dissolving CsI, AgI and SbI3 in DMF (molar ratio 1 : 2 : 2). CsAg2Sb2I9 solar cells gave a power conversion efficiency of 0.99% and a fill factor of 67.1%. The morphology of a CsAg2Sb2I9 film was affected significantly by the CsI content in the precursor solution."
27,"The inverted-planar bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells were fabricated by incorporating nanoparticle MoOx into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite active layers. The results showed that the device performances had been significantly improved, mainly reflected the enhancement of the open-circuit voltage from an average of 0.895 V to 0.959 V. This should be attributed to formation of bulk heterojunctions that can effectively separate and extract the carrier, and reduce carrier recombination. In addition, the conductive atomic force microscopy spectroscopy verified that the surface current of the perovskite-MoOx is larger than that of the pure perovskite film. The relationship between capacitance and frequency was tested and indirectly proved that bulk heterojunctions can rapidly separate the carriers. The ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements provided a reasonable explanation for the MoOx-induced rapidly separating of the carriers. Our research illustrates the application potential of bulk heterojunctions in the perovskite solar cells through doping the MoOx inorganic materials into the perovskite active layer, as well as further consolidates the role of bulk heterojunctions in perovskite active layer."
28,"Mixed tin-lead iodide perovskites exhibit the characteristics of low toxicity and improved light harvesting ability up to nearinfrared (NIR) spectral region, making them as an attractive alternative for traditional lead based perovskites. However, the performance of lead-based perovskites solar cells is still far inferior to their lead analogues owing to the unavoidable oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Here we introduced two-dimensional (2D) perovskite on the top of three dimensional (3D) perovskite film as a capping layer to reduce the self-oxidation, and thus improved the device stability. 2D capping layer was then confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The existence of the 2D protecting thin layer significantly reduce the spontaneous Sn2+ oxidation, thus improve the device performance and reduce the hysteresis. The phenomena could be ascribed to the improved charge extraction efficiency causing by prohibited nonradiative recombination. On top of this, the photovoltaic devices based on conventional-structure configuration were fabricated. Taking advantage of the 2D capping layer, 2D/3D hybrid perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.77 V with short circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.60 mA cm−2, delivering the best-performing power conversion efficiency of 15.5%. Moreover, the 2D/3D perovskite devices maintained 60% its initial efficiency after 40 h exposed in air (humidity around 30%, temperature 22 °C), while 3D perovskite-based devices completely failed."
29,"The lifetime and power conversion efficiency are the key issues for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, the development of 2D/3D perovskite hybrids (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) was firstly demonstrated to be a reliable method to combine their advantages, and provided a new concept for achieving both stable and efficient PSCs through the hybridization of perovskites. 2D/3D perovskite hybrids afforded significantly-improved moisture stability of films and devices without encapsulation in a high humidity of 63 ± 5%, as compared with the 3D perovskite (MAPbIxCl3−x). The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid film did not undergo any degradation after 40 days, while the 3D perovskite decomposed completely under the same conditions after 8 days. The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid device maintained 54% of the original efficiency after 220 hours, whereas the 3D perovskite device lost all the efficiency within only 50 hours. Moreover, the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid achieved comparable device performances (PCE: 13.86%) to the 3D perovskite (PCE: 13.12%) after the optimization of device fabrication conditions."
30,"Antisolvent methods – solvent engineering and a Lewis base adduct approach – are the most used methods to prepare highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These two methods differ only by the ratio between the perovskite (PVSK) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In this study, the difference between these two methods and the effect of relative humidity (rH) on the crystallization process were evaluated by in situ Grazing-Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (in situ GIWAXS) using synchrotron radiation. The technique was applied to the first stages of formation of formamidinium-based perovskite films, under real preparation conditions of spin coating, and at different humidity conditions and time windows to inject the antisolvent. The higher amount of DMSO in the solvent engineering method prolongs the duration of the colloidal gel, which extends the time window for antisolvent injection and, as a consequence, facilitates obtaining films with a homogeneous morphology. Our results confirm that the formation of a cesium/formamidinium-based perovskite takes place through the conversion of 2H–4H hexagonal polytypes directly to a black perovskite without thermal annealing, independent of the rH or method employed. In contrast, a cesium-free, methylammonium/formamidinium-based perovskite follows the 2H–4H–6H polytype sequence. Interestingly, at higher amounts of DMSO and rH (40%), a pure iodide intermediate (MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO) is formed in the cesium-free perovskite, which is undesirable in mixed halide perovskites. Our findings shed new light on the complexity of PVSK film formation, by identifying all crystalline phases in the process, and give clues to manage the composition and environment during film processing, and thus have an impact on efficiency optimization and solar cell manufacturing."
31,"The α-HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite with narrower band gap and higher thermal stability is a promising candidate for high performance perovskite optoelectronic applications. However, it is difficult to achieve fast growth of a phase pure α-FAPbI3 perovskite because the unwanted δ-FAPbI3 usually first forms at lower temperature then converted into the wanted α-FAPbI3 at higher temperature. It takes long time annealing to complete the conversion of δ-FAPbI3 to α-FAPbI3, which could also lead to uncontrollable degradation of α-FAPbI3. Here we report a facile flash deposition of large grain phase pure α-FAPbI3 without any δ-FAPbI3 impurity by inhibiting the δ phase crystallization. In this method, a simple PMMA sealing to synchronize a flash α-crystallization process at appropriate temperature with the unwanted δ phase crystallization. Consequently, a high quality phase pure α-FAPbI3 with large grain size was fabricated into high performance perovskite solar cells. The strategy of flash crystallization would be a promising method for deposition of phase pure perovskite in future."
32,"Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is a more promising broader absorption material than methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, in most cases the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of FAPbI3 based inverted planar PSCs are still lower than those of MAPbI3 ones due to the inferior morphology of FAPbI3 film. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimised formamidinium iodide/isopropyl alcohol (FAI/IPA) modification procedure to improve the photoactive layer for efficient inverted planar FAPbI3 PSCs. The results show that there is an obvious improvement in open circuit voltage, short current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF). Finally, the best PCE of 14.00% with a JSC of 21.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.78 was achieved in low-temperature solution-processed PSCs, which represents a more than 40% enhancement in PCE over that of the PSCs without surface modification. Moreover, the devices exhibit good reproducibility and excellent stability. The simple FAI/IPA modification on the photoactive layer can greatly improve planar FAPbI3 based device performance, which can be a good choice for practical applications."
33,"We report a spray deposition technique as a screening tool for solution processed solar cells. A dual-feed spray nozzle is introduced to deposit donor and acceptor materials separately and to form blended films on substrates in situ. Using a differential pump system with a motorised spray nozzle, the effect of film thickness, solution flow rates and the blend ratio of donor and acceptor materials on device performance can be found in a single experiment. Using this method, polymer solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are fabricated with numerous combinations of thicknesses and blend ratios. Results obtained from this technique show that the optimum ratio of materials is consistent with previously reported values confirming this technique is a very useful and effective screening method. This high throughput screening method is also used in a single-feed configuration. In the single-feed mode, methylammonium iodide solution is deposited on lead iodide films to create a photoactive layer of perovskite solar cells. Devices featuring a perovskite layer fabricated by this spray process demonstrated a power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.9%."
34,"We have fabricated MAPI solar cells using as selective contacts PEDOT:PSS polymer for holes and PCBM-C70 fullerene derivative for electrons. The thickness of MAPI, PCBM-C70, and PEDOT:PSS layers has been varied in order to evaluate the contribution of each layer to the final device performance. We have measured the devices capacitance under illumination and the charge carrier’s lifetime using photoinduced time-resolved techniques. The results show that in this kind of devices the limiting layer is the PCBM-C70 due to its relative reduced mobility compared to PEDOT:PSS that makes the control of the fullerene thickness crucial for device optimization. Moreover, capacitive measurements show differences for the devices having different PCBM-C70 layer thicknesses in contrast with the measurements on the different PEDOT:PSS thickness. These give indications about holes and electrons storage and their distribution"
35,"Simplifying the process of fine-tuning the electronic and optical properties of graphene oxide (GO) is of importance in order to fully utilize it as the hole interfacial layer (HIL). We introduced silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf), an inorganic chemical dopant, that tunes and controls the properties of single-layered GO films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. The morphology, work function, mobility, sheet resistance, and transmittance of the GO film were systematically tuned by various doping concentrations. We further developed a solution-processable low-temperature hole interfacial layer (HIL) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS):AgOTf-doped GO HIL in highly efficient perovskite solar cells. The PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL grants the desirable charge-collection in the HIL allowing the entire device to be prepared at temperatures less than 120 °C. The fabricated perovskite solar cells utilize a rigid substrate and demonstrate compelling photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.90%. Moreover, flexible devices prepared using a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/ITO demonstrate a PCE of 9.67%, while ITO-free flexible devices adopting PET/aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO)/silver (Ag)/AZO demonstrate a PCE of 7.97%. This study shows that the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL has significant potential to contribute to the development of low-cost solar cells"
36,"A facile and low-temperature solution processed UV/ozone process has been proposed for fabricating TiO2 layer, making it possible to fabricate planar perovskite solar cells at low temperature. UV/ozone photo-annealing treatment could easily eliminate the organic components, resulting in high quality amorphous TiO2 films with high transparency, electrical conductivity, and hydrophilicity. In addition, perovskite solar cells with the UV/ozone-treated TiO2 electron transport layer exhibiting the best power conversion efficiency of 11.58% for rigid substrate and 7.33% for flexible substrate, respectively. The results clearly indicate that UV/ozone photo-annealing treatment is a simple and effective process of fabricating high performance flexible perovskite solar cells."
37,"One of the key aspects contributing to the rapid development of perovskite solar cells is to prepare high-quality perovskite films via morphology control and interface engineering. Here, we demonstrate that the additive HPbI3 works effectively on both morphology control and grain boundary passivation of CH3NH3PbI3–xClx thin films. By inducing HPbI3 to the crystal transformation process, high-quality perovskite films consisting of micro-sized grains with boundaries passivated by PbI2 can be readily produced. The perovskite film obtained with HPbI3 as the additive achieves a much longer carrier lifetime compared to the pristine perovskite film without the additive. Under the optimal HPbI3 amount (5.0%), the average power conversion efficiency of the planar-heterojunction solar cells is increased by ∼24% to 17.42% from 14.09% for the device without the additive, and the champion efficiency reaches 18.59%. The devices without any encapsulation show impressive shelf stability, retaining more than 85% of the initial efficiency after being stored in ambient environment for over 40 days."
38,"Ambient-unstable hole transporters and expensive and complicated noble metal electrode deposition are incompatible with the large scale and low-cost production of perovskite solar cells and thus would hamper their commercialization. Herein we report a new modality of perovskite solar cells that do away with the use of conventional hole transporters by directly clamping a selective hole extraction electrode made of candle soot and a deliberately engineered perovskite photoanode. The key soot/perovskite interface, which promotes hole extraction and electron blocking by forming a Schottky junction, was established seamlessly by pre-wetting and reaction embedding the carbon particles. Femtosecond time-resolved photoluminescence revealed a high hole extraction rate at 1.92 ns−1. We have now achieved 11.02% efficiency, making an important step towards roll-to-roll production of perovskite solar cells."
39,"Recently, the efficiency of organolead trihalide perovskite solar cells has improved greatly because of improved material qualities with longer carrier diffusion lengths. Mixing chlorine in the precursor for mixed halide films has been reported to dramatically enhance the diffusion lengths of mixed halide perovskite films, mainly as a result of a much longer carrier recombination lifetime. Here we report that adding Cl containing precursor for mixed halide perovskite formation can induce the abnormal grain growth behavior that yields well-oriented grains accompanied by the appearance of some very large size grains. The abnormal grain growth becomes prominent only after multi-cycle coating of MAI : MACl blend precursor. The large grain size is found mainly to contribute to a longer carrier charge recombination lifetime, and thus increases the device efficiency to 18.9%, but without significantly impacting the carrier transport property. The strong correlation identified between material process and morphology provides guidelines for future material optimization and device efficiency enhancement."
40,"Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)-based perovskite has attracted increasing attention of researchers due to its lower band gap and improved thermal stability. However, it is structurally unstable and easy to phase-transfer at room temperature. Here, we improve the structural stability of perovskite by controlling its orientation diversity. XRD results show that incorporating CsBr into FAPbI3 is effective to adjust the crystal plane stacking. For the first time, an orientation diversity factor (ODF) is identified, and it is found that an increased ODF is propitious to decrease the lattice distortion and relax the microstrain in the crystal, boosting the efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The optimized inverted PSC based on FA0.85Cs0.15PbI2.85Br0.15 achieves efficiency of 17.59% and presents ignored performance decline under continuous light-soaking for 500 h."
41,"The quality of perovskite absorber is one of the most important factors to influence the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still challenging to obtain perovskite layers with required properties including large grain sizes, better crystallinity, less grain boundaries, and uniform morphology by the current preparation techniques. Here we develop a novel method, where the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into the chlorobenzene anti-solvent to improve the MAPbI3 film quality in terms of film structure, morphology and crystallinity, leading to reduced charge recombination and improved charge transfer. CsPbBr3 NPs play a role as nucleation centers in the growth process of perovskite films, and CsPbBr3 NPs also induce a passivation layer Cs1-yMAyPbI3-xBrx on the top of perovskite layer. The charge transport and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are improved due to the introduction of CsPbBr3 NPs. A champion PCE of 20.46% is obtained for the PSCs based on high quality perovskite film prepared with CsPbBr3 NPs. In addition, the PSCs with CsPbBr3 NPs also exhibit improved stability. This work not only demonstrates a novel strategy to prepare high quality perovskite films for PSCs with high efficiency and stability, but also provides important insight in the growth mechanisms of perovskite films toward high crystallinity and less defects."
42,"In perovskite solar cells, the morphology of the porous TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) largely determines the quality of the perovskites. Here, we chose micro-scale TiO2 (0.2 µm) and compared it with the conventional nanoscale TiO2 (20 nm) in relation to the crystallinity of perovskites. The results show that the micro-scale TiO2 is favorable for increasing the grain size of the perovskites and enhancing the light scattering. However, the oversized TiO2 results in an uneven surface. The evenness of the perovskites can be improved by nanoscale TiO2, while the crystallinity and compactness are not as good as those of the films based on micro-scale TiO2. To combine the advantages of both micro-scale and nanoscale TiO2, by mixing 0.2 µm/20 nm TiO2 with a ratio of $1:2$ as the composite ETL, the device average power conversion efficiency was increased to 11.2% from 9.9% in the case of only 20 nm TiO2."
43,"Charge carrier transport layer made of aligned ZnO nanowires (NW) coated with TiO2 layer via low-temperature hydrolysis process for perovskite solar cells (PSC) applications. Aligned ZnO NWs were grown by solution approach onto transparent conducting oxide substrates and treated with 25 mM of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). TiO2 layered ZnO NWs were composed of single crystalline, uniformly covered with amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Such TiO2 layered ZnO NW architecture, with the unique combination of high surface-area and infiltration of perovskite more into the electrode and a maximum photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.30 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.05% are demonstrated, which is higher than the ZnO NWs. Dark current density is decreased for TiO2 layered ZnO NW-based PSCs, due to the good interface formation between the electrode/sensitizer and it has higher energy barrier to overcome required high onset potential. TiO2 layered ZnO NWs architecture opens up a novel configuration for high-performance optoelectronic devices."
44,"In this study we design and construct high-efficiency, low-cost, highly stable, hole-conductor-free, solid-state perovskite solar cells, with TiO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) and carbon as the hole collection layer, in ambient air. First, uniform, pinhole-free TiO2 films of various thicknesses were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology. Based on these TiO2 films, a series of hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with carbon as the counter electrode were fabricated in ambient air, and the effect of thickness of TiO2 compact film on the device performance was investigated in detail. It was found that the performance of PSCs depends on the thickness of the compact layer due to the difference in surface roughness, transmittance, charge transport resistance, electron–hole recombination rate, and the charge lifetime. The best-performance devices based on optimized TiO2 compact film (by 2000 cycles ALD) can achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of as high as 7.82%. Furthermore, they can maintain over 96% of their initial PCE after 651 h (about 1 month) storage in ambient air, thus exhibiting excellent long-term stability."
45,"The role of additives in spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport material (HTM) has been found to be vitally important for achieving decent photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Four spiro-OMeTAD recipes with controlled concentrations of additives are studied in the context of PSCs. It is found that a small change in the concentration of additives results in a huge difference in the overall power conversion efficiency, which stems from the distinct charge extraction process in PSCs. Furthermore, the effect of the third additive, a cobalt complex (FK102, Co(III)TFSI), on the carrier density and charge recombination in PSCs is extensively investigated. It is found that the presence of the cobalt additive can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs via the suppression of charge recombination at the interface of the perovskite layer and the HTM layer, which leads to a more than doubled power conversion efficiency."
46,"In this work, the crystallization dependent stability of perovskite solar cells with different hole transporting layers (HTLs), i.e., PEDOT: PSS and Cu:NiOx is studied. The evolution of photovoltaic performance over time is demonstrated to be associated with the variety of crystallized quality and conductivity of as-prepared films. The potential mechanisms behind the device are also provided in view of the microscopic kinetics of crystallization combined with the varied conductivity of HTLs induced by the ambient atmosphere."
47,"In high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the electron transport layer (ETL) has overwhelmingly been dominated by compact titanium oxide (TiO2), which typically requires sintering at around 500 °C. Such a high-temperature sintering procedure prevents TiO2-based PSCs from matching well with plastic substrates and low-cost manufacturing. Here we report cerium oxide (CeOx, x = 1.87), that was prepared facilely through a simple sol–gel method at low temperature (∼150 °C), as an alternative to high-temperature sintering processed TiO2 in the regular architecture of PSCs. With a PCE of 14.32% from the involvement of an optimized CeOx ETL through adjusting the precursor solution, and a higher PCE of 17.04% through introducing a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) interfacial layer between the CeOx ETL and the perovskite layer, the present work about CeOx-based PSCs renders low-temperature solution-processed CeOx an excellent ETL for high performance perovskite solar cells with improved stability."
48,"We reveal substantial luminescence yield heterogeneity among individual subdiffraction grains of high-performing methylammonium lead halide perovskite films by using high-resolution cathodoluminescence microscopy. Using considerably lower accelerating voltages than is conventional in scanning electron microscopy, we image the electron beam-induced luminescence of the films and statistically characterize the depth-dependent role of defects that promote nonradiative recombination losses. The highest variability in the luminescence intensity is observed at the exposed grain surfaces, which we attribute to surface defects. By probing deeper into the film, it appears that bulk defects are more homogeneously distributed. By identifying the origin and variability of a surface-specific loss mechanism that deleteriously impacts device efficiency, we suggest that producing films homogeneously composed of the highest-luminescence grains found in this study could result in a dramatic improvement of overall device efficiency. We also show that although cathodoluminescence microscopy is generally used only to image inorganic materials it can be a powerful tool to investigate radiative and nonradiative charge carrier recombination on the nanoscale in organic–inorganic hybrid materials."
49,"Owing to the high charge mobility and low processing temperature, ZnO is regarded as an ideal candidate for electron transport layer (ETL) material in thin-film solar cells. For the film preparation, the presently dominated sol–gel (SG) and hydrolysis–condensation (HC) methods show great potential; however, the effect of these two methods on the performance of the resulting devices has not been investigated in the same frame. In this study, the ZnO films made through SG and HC methods were applied in perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs), and the performances of corresponding devices were compared under parallel conditions. We found that the surface morphologies and the conductivities of the films prepared by SG and HC methods showed great differences. The HC-ZnO films with higher conductivity led to relatively higher device performance, and the best power conversion efficiencie (PCE) of 12.9% was obtained; meanwhile, for Pero-SCs based on SG-ZnO, the best PCE achieved was 10.9%. The better device performance of Pero-SCs based on HC-ZnO should be attributed to the better charge extraction and transportation ability of HC-ZnO film. Moreover, to further enhance the performance of Pero-SCs, a thin layer of pristine C60 was introduced between HC-ZnO and perovskite layers. By doing so, the quality of perovskite films was improved, and the PCE was elevated to 14.1%. The preparation of HC-ZnO film involves relatively lower-temperature (maximum 100 °C) processing; the films showed better charge extraction and transportation properties and can be a more promising ETL material in Pero-SCs"
50,"Effects of AsI3 and NH4Cl addition to perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions on photovoltaic properties were investigated. TiO2/CH3NH3Pb(As)I3(Cl)-based photovoltaic devices were fabricated by a spin-coating technique, and the microstructures of the devices were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Current density-voltage characteristics and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies were improved by a small amount of As- and Cl-doping, which resulted in improvement of the efficiencies of the devices."
51,"Aligned and flexible electrospun carbon nanomaterials are used to synthesize carbon/perovskite nanocomposites. The free-electron diffusion length in the CH3NH3PbI3 phase of the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon nanocomposite is almost twice that of bare CH3NH3PbI3, and nearly 95 % of the photogenerated free holes can be injected from the CH3NH3PbI3 phase into the carbon nanomaterial. The exciton binding energy of the composite is estimated to be 23 meV by utilizing temperature-dependent optical absorption spectroscopy. The calculated free carriers increase with increasing total photoexcitation density, and this broadens the potential of this material for a broad range of optoelectronics applications. A metal-electrode-free perovskite solar cell (power conversion efficiency: 13.0 %) is fabricated with this perovskite/carbon composite, which shows great potential for the fabrication of efficient, large-scale, low-cost, and metal-electrode-free perovskite solar cells."
52,"Interface engineering is an efficient method for improving the performance of inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, the PSCs were modified by introducing mild argon plasma post-treatment on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced up to 12.17%, compared with 9.55% of the reference device without interlayer modification. We found that argon plasma treatment on the PEDOT:PSS layer effectively increases its conductivity due to the modification of the PSS ratio in the film. The argon plasma treatment time directly affects the surface morphologies and contact angles of the PEDOT:PSS layer and therefore optimises the uniformity of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the nanometer-scale. The improvement in the chemical compositions and film morphologies of PEDOT:PSS could be beneficial to enhancing the wettability and retarding the carrier recombination. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) of PSCs based on the treated PEDOT:PSS were both improved, resulting in the enhancement of PCE."
53,"Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention due to their unique properties and rapid increased power conversion efficiency. Currently, PC61BM is widely used as the electron transport layer (ETL) for inverted hybrid perovksite solar cells. Here we propose and demonstrate that Bi2S3, a ribboned compound with intrinsic high mobility and stability, could be used as the ETL for perovksite solar cells. Through a simple thermal evaporation with the substrate kept at room temperature, we successfully produced a compact and smooth amorphous Bi2S3 ETL with high conductivity. Our NiO/CH3NH3PbI3/Bi2S3 solar cell achieved a device efficiency of 13%, which is comparable with our counterpart device using PC61BM as the ETL. Moreover, our device showed much improved ambient storage stability due to the hydrophobic and hermetic encapsulation of the perovskite layer by the Bi2S3 ETL. We believe thermally evaporated Bi2S3 is a promising ETL for inverted hybrid perovskite solar cells and worthy of further exploration."
54,"We report for the first time on co-sensitization between CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and PbS quantum dots (QDs) in a heterojunction solar cell to obtain a panchromatic response from the visible to near IR regions. Following the deposition of the sensitizers on a TiO2 film, an Au thin layer is evaporated on top as a back contact. Importantly, the CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles and the PbS QDs used here simultaneously play both the role of a light harvester and a hole conductor, rendering superfluous the use of an additional hole transporting material. The mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3 (perovskite)–PbS (QD)/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell shows an impressive short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 24.63 mA cm−2, much higher than those of the individual CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the PbS QD solar cells. The advent of such co-sensitization mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells paves the way to extend the absorbance region of the promising low cost, high-efficiency perovskite based solar cells."
55,"Photoelectric conversion efficiency enhancement of the emerging highly efficient, low cost organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells, which is considered as a promising candidate in solar energy industry, has received great attention. And, it is investigated that the device performance can be significantly improved simply by a convenient morphology controlling approach aiming at obtaining uniform and high coverage of perovskite. However, reliable means to prepare high-quality perovskite layer remains to be a big challenge. In this work, we proposed a novel, simple and efficient method in optimizing the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. Utilizing this excellent rapid fabrication process, our devices present an average power conversion efficiency of 9.65% with remarkable reproducibility, which is about 42% higher with respect to devices produced by regular protocol. This work sheds a light on enhancing performance of the state-of-the-art solar cells by exploring novel methods to prepare photoactive layers of high-quality."
56,"Simultaneously modulating the optical and electrical properties of the hole transporting layer (HTL) plays a vital role in the performance of p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a negligible hysteresis inverted planar PSC with 17.30% power conversion efficiency was successfully fabricated by employing a thin and non-stoichiometric dopant-free nickel oxide (DF-NiOx) film as the HTL. The DF-NiOx film was formed by a radio frequency magnetron sputtering method. The Ni3+ content as well as the crystallization of the DF-NiOx thin films were tuned by regulating the post-annealing treatment, leading to enhanced optical transmittance and electrical conductivity. The optimized DF-NiOx films exhibit a high transmittance of more than 90%, appropriate conductivity, uniform surface morphology, and a better energy level match with the perovskite layer. This study not only highlights the importance of optimizing the Ni3+ content and crystallization for the formation of high-performance DF-NiOx HTLs, but also provides an excellent device platform for making large area high-performance PSCs and tandem solar cells."
57,"Nano-structured CuO-Cu2O complex thin film-based perovskite solar cells were fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass and studied. Copper (Cu) thin films with a purity of 99.995 % were deposited on an ITO-coated glass by magnetron reactive sputtering. To optimize the properties of the nano-structured CuO-Cu2O complex thin films, the deposited Cu thin films were thermally oxidized at various temperatures from 300 to 400 °C. A CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber was fabricated on top of CuO-Cu2O complex thin film by a one-step spin-coating process with a toluene washing treatment. Following optimization, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeded 8.1 %. Therefore, the low-cost, solution-processed, stable nano-structured CuO-Cu2O complex thin film can be used as an alternative hole transport layer (HTL) in industrially produced perovskite solar cells."
58,"As promising highly-efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices, perovskite solar cells must be made of compact and pin-hole free perovskite films. One-step solution engineering is a most efficient and low-cost precipitation of high quality perovskite films. However, the difficulty in controlling the precipitation and pin-hole formation in perovskite films makes this one-step solution engineering a great challenge. Here, we report, for the first time, a fast and high performance perovskite film precipitation by tuning the boundary layer during the solution processing of the perovskite film. Theoretical analyses and simulations were carried out alongside the experiments, and the results consistently showed that a high velocity and low temperature of the air flow could effectively reduce the thickness of the boundary layer. Subsequently, evaporated solvent molecules would diffuse through the boundary layer more easily, and then solvent evaporation becomes quicker, resulting in a high quality and pin-hole free perovskite film. As a result, the highest efficiency of 17.87% was achieved for planar perovskite solar cells (with an active area of 0.1 cm2) with the perovskite film precipitated under these air conditions. Furthermore, the efficiency reached as high as 12.72% with a 1.08 V open-circuit voltage for a 1 cm2 planar perovskite device. This essentially opens the door to developing high quality perovskite film precipitation approaches by tuning the boundary layer during facile one-step solution engineering."
59,"The environmental friendly tin-based perovskite is attracting a lot of attention as a lead-free alternative in photovoltaic field. However, the uncontrollable quick crystallization of tin-based perovskite in traditional solution methods makes it challenging to form smooth and pin-hole free films, resulting in severe surface recombination and current leakage problem. Evaporation method, known as an effective way to produce smooth films with high coverage, has been rarely investigated in tin-based perovskites. Here, we demonstrate an evaporation-assisted solution (EAS) method in CsSnI3 system, combining thermal evaporation with solution method, to produce rather uniform, dense and pinhole free CsSnI3 films. Solar cells fabricated by our EAS method show an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.93% and a best PCE of 2.23%."
60,"Chemical doping of organic semiconductors has been recognized as an effective way to enhance the electrical conductivity. In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), various types of dopants have been developed for organic hole transport materials (HTMs); however, the knowledge of the basic requirements for being efficient dopants as well as the comprehensive roles of the dopants in PSCs has not been clearly revealed. Here, three copper-based complexes with controlled redox activities are applied as dopants in PSCs, and it is found that the oxidative reactivity of dopants presents substantial impacts on conductivity, charge dynamics, and solar cell performance. A significant improvement of open-circuit voltage (Voc) by more than 100 mV and an increase of power conversion efficiency from 13.2 to 19.3% have been achieved by tuning the doping level of the HTM. The observed large variation of Voc for three dopants reveals their different recombination kinetics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces and suggests a model of an interfacial recombination mechanism. We also suggest that the dopants in HTMs can also affect the charge recombination kinetics as well as the solar cell performance. Based on these findings, a strategy is proposed to physically passivate the electron–hole recombination by inserting an ultrathin Al2O3 insulating layer between the perovskite and the HTM. This strategy contributes a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability, indicating that dopant engineering is one crucial way to further improve the performance of PSCs."
61,"Over the past several years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have developed rapidly. One of the hot topics with perovskite solar cells is how to achieve a high quality perovskite thin film. A Lewis acid–base adduct is effective for controlling perovskite morphology during the film preparation process. Zinc ion (Zn2+) is a stronger Lewis acid than lead ion (Pb2+) and it has a high ability to coordinate with methylamine groups (CH3NH3+), so it is doped into perovskite precursors to substitute for Pb2+ to influence crystallization during the annealing process. In this work, by adjusting zinc ions concentration, high quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and fewer pinholes were obtained. Finally, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on optimal concentration reached to 16.3% (with an open circuit voltage of 1.06 V, short circuit current density of 21.98 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 70%), resulting in a 34.7% improvement compared to a pristine one. Our work highlights the metal-ion additive as an effective method to control perovskite film quality."
62,"Indium oxide (In2O3) as a promising n-type semiconductor material has been widely employed in optoelectronic applications. In this work, we applied low-temperature solution-processed In2O3 nanocrystalline film as an electron selective layer (ESL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. By taking advantages of good optical and electrical properties of In2O3 such as high mobility, wide band gap, and high transmittance, we obtained In2O3-based PSCs with a good efficiency exceeding 13% after optimizing the concentration of the precursor solution and the annealing temperature. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the In2O3-based PSCs, a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer was introduced to modify the surface of the In2O3 film. The PCBM film could fill up the pinholes or cracks along In2O3 grain boundaries to passivate the defects and make the ESL extremely compact and uniform, which is conducive to suppressing the charge recombination. As a result, the efficiency of the In2O3-based PSC was improved to 14.83% accompanied with VOC, JSC, and FF being 1.08 V, 20.06 mA cm–2, and 0.685, respectively."
63,"Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting great attention. A conjugated organic molecule, bathocuproine (BCP), is often deposited on C60 for electron collection in inverted PSCs. But organic molecules are not stable against UV light and cannot act as good barrier layers to protect the perovskite layer. In principle, inorganic materials can have better stability, but the thermal deposition of inorganic materials usually requires very high temperature. In this work, zinc selenide (ZnSe), a two-dimensional (2D) II–VI semiconductor material with a wide bandgap and high electron mobility, is investigated for electron collection in PSCs without BCP. The ZnSe layer is deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. The PSCs with ZnSe can exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.38%, comparable to that with BCP. In addition, the former has better stability than the latter. We also demonstrate PSCs with inorganic materials for both hole and electron collection."
64,"In this communication, glycine, an amino acid, was applied to modify the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction interface for reducing the inevitable defects formed during crystallization of perovskite. The power conversion efficiency of the resulting perovskite solar cell was increased from 8.35 to 12.02%, attributed to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density."
65,"Solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as a very promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their superior semiconducting properties. Although the performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has already been demonstrated to rival those of the prevailing inorganic counterparts, the device's long-term stability under thermal, photo-, and moisture stresses has been raised as one major challenge before the commercialization of this technology. Here, we have designed and synthesized a crosslinkable n-type conjugated molecule, c-HATNA, to serve as the electron-transporting layer on top of the perovskite to improve photo-, moisture, and thermal stability of the fabricated PVSCs. This work has validated the method of incorporating facile crosslinkable charge transport layers to improve efficiency and ambient and thermal stability of resultant solar cells to benefit large-scale device fabrication."
66,"Thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements are used to characterize electronic trap states in methylammonium lead iodide perovsite solar cells. Several TSC peaks were observed over the temperature range from 20 K to room temperature. To elucidate the origins of these peaks, devices with various organic charge transport layers and devices without transport layers were tested. Two peaks appear at very low temperatures, indicating shallow trap states that are mainly attributed to the PCBM/C60 electron transport bilayer. However, two additional peaks appear at higher temperatures, that is, they are deeper in energy, and are assigned to the perovskite layer. At around T = 163 K, a sharp peak, also present in the dark TSC measurements, is assigned to the orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition in the perovskite. However, a peak at around T = 191 K is assigned to trap states with activation energies of around 500 meV but with a rather low concentration of 1 × 1021 m–3."
67,"The ability to process amorphous or polycrystalline solar cells at low temperature (<150 °C) opens many possibilities for substrate choice and monolithic multijunction solar cell fabrication. Organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells have evolved rapidly over the last two years, and the CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, I or Br) material is processed at low temperature. However the first embodiments of the solar cell were composed of high temperature processed (500 °C) compact and mesoporous layers of TiO2. The sintering of the mesoporous TiO2 has been negated by replacing this with a mesoporous insulating scaffold in the meso-superstructured solar cell (MSSC), yet the high temperature processed compact TiO2 layer still persists in the most efficient devices. Here we have realised a low temperature route for compact TiO2, tailored for perovskite MSSC operation. With our optimized formulation we demonstrate full sun solar power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.9% in an all low temperature processed solar cell."
68,"Standard layer-by-layer solution processing methods constrain lead–halide perovskite device architectures. The layer below the perovskite must be robust to the strong organic solvents used to form the perovskite while the layer above has a limited thermal budget and must be processed in nonpolar solvents to prevent perovskite degradation. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminesence spectroscopy, we show that this procedure improves photovoltaic properties of the perovskite layer. Applying this procedure, semitransparent devices employing two high-temperature oxide transport layers were fabricated, which realized an average efficiency of 9.6% (maximum: 10.6%) despite series resistance limitations from the substrate design. Overall, the developed lamination procedure curtails processing constraints, enables new device designs, and affords new opportunities for optimization."
69,"High efficiency and stable hole transporting material-free (HTM-free) planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells are constructed by directly thermal evaporating perovskite materials onto indium tin oxide substrate. A condense and homogeneous morphology is found for this perovskite film even without any annealing process. The optimized HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/C60 PHJ device with a 35 nm ultra-thin CH3NH3PbI3−XClX layer presents a high hole extraction efficiency and a low charge carrier recombination probability, which results in a high short circuit current and fill factor. The HTM-free device shows a high power conversion efficiency of 8.37%, which is one of the highest efficiency among reported inverted HTM-free perovskite solar cells even that a thinner perovskite film is used. More importantly, the device also exhibits a superior stability in ambient conditions."
70,"A new approach to improve the quality of MAPbI3 − x Cl x perovskite film was demonstrated. It involves annealing the precursor film after pumping away the solvent, which can decrease the influence of solvent evaporation rate for the growth of the MAPbI3 − x Cl x perovskite film. The resulting film showed improved morphology, stronger absorption, fewer crystal defects, and smaller charge transfer resistance. The corresponding device demonstrated enhanced performance when compared with a reference device. The averaged value of power conversion efficiency increased from 10.61 to 12.56 %, and a champion efficiency of 14.0 % was achieved. This work paves a new way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells."
71,"One-step solution process is a facile and widely used procedure to prepare organic–inorganic perovskite materials. However, the poor surface morphology of the films attributed to the uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth in the process is unfavorable to solar cells. In this study, an anti-solvent treatment during the one-step solution process, in which ethyl acetate (EA) was dropped on the sample during spinning the precursor solution containing CH3NH3Cl, was adopted to fabricate perovskite materials and solar cells. It was found that the morphology of the perovskite film was significantly improved due to the rapid nucleation and slow crystal growth process. The modified process enabled us to fabricate the mesoporous solar cell with power conversion efficiency of 14%, showing an improvement of 40% over the efficiency of 9.7% of the device prepared by conventional one-step method. The controlling effect of annealing time on the morphology, crystal structure and transport properties of perovskite layer as well as the performance of device fabricated by the anti-solvent method were investigated and the possible mechanism was discussed."
72,"Here we investigate temperature-dependent charge transport in solution-processed methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite thin films with steady-state mobility measurements. Based on control of the thickness (L) of the MAPbI3 films, one attains tunability in the carrier mobility, trap density and recombination that lead to alterations in the device characteristics. We find that the increased hole mobility in MAPbI3 with incremental variations in L is associated with reduction in the trap concentration and Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. By interrogating the ideality factor, we identify that the SRH charge recombination is present in the optimal solar cell. Of interest, the impact of traps on recombination becomes weakened and eventually is overwhelmed by bimolecular recombination with increasing L. Photoluminescence decay kinetics reveal that the PL related to surface and bulk recombination is longer-lived at larger L, in line with the results based on electrical analysis. The meliorated transport properties with reduced charge trapping in MAPbI3 films can correlate to the slightly enhanced crystallinity and homogeneity in the grain size distribution in thicker films. The combinatorial study shows that the transport properties alongside traps in MAPbI3 films are tunable simply by the physical parameter of L. Meanwhile, our work points to the necessity to further reduce the trap density so as to boost the photovoltaic performance using perovskite thin films."
73,"Inverted perovskite solar cells have attracted a great deal of attention due to its high power conversion efficiency, simple configuration, and low-cost processing. The hole transport material (HTM) is a crucial factor in high performance inverted perovskite solar cell. However, the hole mobility for most common of HTM is too low to matching perovskite materials. Herein, we report a superior HTM with high hole mobility to significantly improve solar cell efficiency. Upon doing the commonly used PEDOT:PSS HTM by graphene oxide (GO), its hole mobility is increased from 5.55 × 10−5 to 1.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, leading to efficient hole extraction and low current leakage, therefore 20% higher power conversion efficiency comparing to the control device without the GO doping. The development open the opportunities for efficient HTMs based on the two-dimensional materials in the perovskite solar cells."
74,"In this work, four tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-centered hole transport materials (HTMs), with 2,7- or 3,6-substituted carbazole derivatives as periphery groups are deliberately synthesized and characterized. Their photophysical properties, energy levels, and photovoltaic performances are systematically investigated, and their performances as HTMs are discussed with respect to the different substituent positions on the carbazole moiety. It is interesting to find that the TPE-based HTMs with 2,7-carbazole substituents rival the 3,6-carbazole substituents in hole mobility and hole extraction ability. A high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.74 % is achieved for the devices based on the 2,7-carbazole periphery arms, which is even higher than the one of the “star” HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2-7,7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenylamine 9,9′-spirobifluorene) under the same conditions. As far as we know, this is the highest efficiency achieved in tetraphenylethylene derivatives."
75,"Inspired by the rapid rise in efficiencies of lead halide perovskite (LHP) solar cells, lead-free alternatives are attracting increasing attention. In this work, we study the photovoltaic potential of solution-processed antimony (Sb)-based compounds with the formula A3Sb2I9 (A = Cs, Rb, and K). We experimentally determine bandgap magnitude and type, structure, carrier lifetime, exciton binding energy, film morphology, and photovoltaic device performance. We use density functional theory to compute the equilibrium structures, band structures, carrier effective masses, and phase stability diagrams. We find the A-site cation governs the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Cs3Sb2I9 has a 0D structure, the largest exciton binding energy (175 ± 9 meV), an indirect bandgap, and, in a solar cell, low photocurrent (0.13 mA cm–2). Rb3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, a direct bandgap, and, among the materials investigated, the lowest exciton binding energy (101 ± 6 meV) and highest photocurrent (1.67 mA cm–2). K3Sb2I9 has a 2D structure, intermediate exciton binding energies (129 ± 9 meV), and intermediate photocurrents (0.41 mA cm–2). Despite remarkably long lifetimes in all compounds (54, 9, and 30 ns for Cs-, Rb-, and K-based materials, respectively), low photocurrents limit performance of all devices. We conclude that carrier collection is limited by large exciton binding energies (experimentally observed) and large carrier effective masses (calculated from density functional theory). The highest photocurrent and efficiency (0.76%) were observed in the Rb-based compound with a direct bandgap, relatively lower exciton binding energy, and lower calculated electron effective mass. To reliably screen for candidate lead-free photovoltaic absorbers, we advise that faster and more accurate computational tools are needed to calculate exciton binding energies and effective masses."
76,This study successfully demonstrates the application of inorganic p-type nickel oxide (NiOx ) as electrode interlayer for the fabrication of NiOx /CH3 NH3 PbI3 perovskite/PCBM PHJ hybrid solar cells with a respectable solar-to-electrical PCE of 7.8%. The better energy level alignment and improved wetting of the NiOx electrode interlayer significantly enhance the overall photovoltaic performance. 
77,"Methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (MAPbX3, where MA is methylammonium, and X is a halide)-based solar cells have been intensively investigated recently,1 with the demonstrated certified solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20%.2 To further boost the PCE to beyond the Schockley–Queisser limit,3 tandem structured solar cells have been investigated based on integrating MAPbX3 and low bandgap solar cells.4-8 However, the efficiency of the two-terminal integrated perovskite-silicon tandem cells is still low. The best reported efficiency of 13.7% for this type of tandem cells is far smaller than the individual cells yet, partially due to the limited performance of the mixed-halide perovskite MAPbBrxI3–x solar cell employed in this structure.5 The mixed-halide perovskite MAPbBrxI3–x is still one of the most promising candidates as the wide-bandgap light absorber for the tandem application to match the bandgap of silicon, considering its continuously tunable bandgap from 1.6 eV to 2.3 eV with different bromide incorporation ratio.7, 9, 10 However, the application of MAPbBrxI3–x based solar cells has been reported to confront with one big challenge of intrinsic light instability.11 The MAPbBrxI3–x materials on mesoporous scaffold were shown to be unstable under illumination with a photo-excited phase-separation into two phases, one iodine-rich phase and one iodine-poor phase.11, 12 The lower bandgap phase thus acts as the charge traps, which was hypothesized to be responsible to the severely reduced device open circuit voltage and device PCE for the mixed-halide perovskite devices"
78,"The short-circuit current density of inverted perovskite solar cells is unsatisfactory due to the intrinsic relatively low electron mobility and electrical conductivity of PC61BM. To solve this problem, a solution-processed mixed-fullerene derivative electron transporting material by mixing PC61BM with C60 was developed to improve charge extraction capacity in fully low temperature processed devices. Incorporation of C60 into the PC61BM layer improves the mobility from 2.15×10−3 to 4.71×10−3 cm2⋅V−1⋅s−1 and the conductivity of electron transporting layers, thus enhancing the interfacial electron extraction capacity and reducing the electron transfer resistance. As a result, the average power conversion efficiency increases from 12.80% to 15.47% by 21% due to the significant increases in the average short-circuit current density from 19.26 to 22.08 mA⋅cm−2 by 15%. Meanwhile, the optimal efficiency of 16.44% with rigid substrates and 12.93% with flexible substrates are obtained with almost no hysteresis. This work provides a novel and simple method to greatly improve the short-circuit current density and hence the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells."
79,"We demonstrate a novel one-step solution approach to prepare perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films by adding CH3NH3Cl (or MACl) to the standard CH3NH3PbI3 precursor (equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2) solution. The use of MACl strongly affects the crystallization process of forming pure CH3NH3PbI3, leading not only to enhanced absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 but also to significantly improved coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 on a planar substrate. Compared to the standard one-step solution approach for CH3NH3PbI3, using MACl improves the performance of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells from about 2% to 12% for the planar cell structure and from about 8% to 10% for the mesostructured device architecture. Although we find no significant effect of using MACl on charge transport and recombination in mesostructured perovskite cells, the recombination resistance for planar cells increases by 1–2 orders of magnitude by using MACl. These results suggest that this new one-step solution approach is promising for controlling CH3NH3PbI3 growth to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells."
80,"Biaxially-extended octithiophene-based conjugated polymers are demonstrated as effective polymeric hole-transporting layers (HTLs) to simultaneously enhance the efficiency and UV-photostability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The intense UV absorption contributed from the conjugated side-chain groups of such polymers facilitated its function of UV filtering when serving as the bottom HTL in PVSCs. Through rationally tailoring polymer backbone structure, a highly efficient (PCE: 18.34%) PVSC with much improved UV-photostability and ambient stability was successfully achieved."
81,"Metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) as an important class of organic semiconductors or hole transport materials (HTMs) have been extensively used in organic solar cells. Nevertheless, most of them are highly insoluble and need to be processed through a strict high-vacuum deposition process. Herein, a solution-processable tert-butyl substituted zinc phthalocyanine (hereafter referred to as ZnPc(tBu)4) with relatively high hole mobility and favorable HOMO and LUMO levels has been synthesized and employed as dopant-free HTM layer in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the corresponding ZnPc(tBu)4-based PSCs after optimizing the ZnPc(tBu)4 concentration achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.16% and 7.98% measured under forward and reverse voltage scanning, respectively. The unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance of ZnPc(tBu)4-based PSCs compared to the classical spiro-OMeTAD-based ones can be mainly due to the very low fill factor and severe hysteresis, which would be eliminated by further optimizing the device fabrication procedure and the interfacial contacts between the mesoporous TiO2 film and MAPbI3 overlayer, and thus the present solution-processable and dopant-free ZnPc(tBu)4 would be a potential substitute for the expensive HTMs containing multifold additives used in the current PSCs."
82,"To enhance the light harvesting capability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), TiO2 nanoparticles/nanotubes (TNNs) were incorporated into the active layer of PSCs. The TNN-containing cells showed a substantial increase in photocurrent density (JSC), from 23.9 mA/cm2 without nanotubes to 25.5 mA/cm2, suggesting that the TiO2 nanotubes enhanced the charge conduction and harvested more sunlight, which was attributed to the Mie scattering effect. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TiO2 nanoparticles in the active layer (14.16%), the TNN-containing cells with optimal loading of 9 wt % TiO2 nanotubes showed a high PCE of 15.34%. "
83,"We demonstrate efficiency enhancement in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing a free-dopant hole transporting material (HTM), non-peripherally substituted octapentyl phthalocyanine (C5PcH2) with thermal annealing. Particularly, by using thermal annealing approach, the external quantum efficiency at around 480 nm increase from 78 to 84%. Hence, the fill factor and short-circuit current density are markedly improved from 0.35 ± 0.02 to 0.55 ± 0.05 and from 18 ± 1 to 18.8 ± 0.3 mA cm-2, respectively. Finally, the best device is achieved with power conversion efficiencies of 12.2% by annealing at 130 °C for 10 min. The photoluminescence and photo-induced charge carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltages measurements indicate that the charge carrier mobility in C5PcH2 increases, and thereby the hole extraction and transportation from the perovskite layer to the Au anode as well the photovoltaic performance of PCS is improved by using thermal annealing processing"
84,"The major restraint for the commercialization of the high-performance hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells is the long-term stability, especially at the infirm interface between the perovskite film and organic charge-transfer layer. Recently, engineering the interface between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD becomes an effective strategy to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability in the perovskite solar cells. In this work, we demonstrated that introducing an interfacial polystyrene layer between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD layer can effectively improve the perovskite solar cells photovoltaic performance. The inserted polystyrene layer can passivate the interface traps and defects effectively and decrease the nonradiative recombination, leading to enhanced photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, without compromising the carrier extraction and transfer. Under the optimized condition, the perovskite solar cells with the polystyrene layer achieve an enhanced average power efficiency of about 19.61% (20.46% of the best efficiency) from about 17.63% with negligible current density–voltage hysteresis. Moreover, the optimized perovskite solar cells with the hydrophobic polystyrene layer can maintain about 85% initial efficiency after 2 months storage in open air conditions without encapsulation."
85,"To reduce intrinsic defect density in perovskite films, various additives are often added into the precursor solution. In this paper, a novel solution, in which isopropanol (IPA) was added into the precursor solution, was developed for the preparation of normal planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.70 % was achieved with this approach. By adding IPA into the precursor solution, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite showed better crystallization and stability, indicating improved film quality. Because of the improved morphology of perovskite crystal, the PCE of PSCs increased. In addition, the unencapsulated PSCs retained high output for up to 40 days in air at room temperature, indicating the stability of PSCs. These results may provide a new avenue for manufacturing high efficiency and high stability PSCs."
86,"Novel symmetric oligomer hole transporting materials (HTMs) incorporating 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) cores have been synthesized and tested for high performance perovskite solar cells. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 14.23% has been achieved by employing DPEDOT-B[BMPDP]2 with the electron donating EDOT unit as the core, which is comparable to that of the traditional spiro-OMeTAD (14.55%)."
87,"A two-step method is widely used to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In a typical two-step method, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites are fabricated from PbI2 films through an intercalation reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, which usually have a rough surface and residual PbI2 due to a compact PbI2 structure. Here, we introduce some strong Lewis bases into PbI2/DMF solutions in the first step, which is helpful in controlling the morphology of PbI2 films with a mesoporous structure. The mesopores in the PbI2 films provide not only space for accommodating the volume expansion during the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, but also channels for CH3NH3I solution to diffuse into the PbI2 films, which helps eliminate the residual PbI2 and the dissolution and recrystallization process. As a result, smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2 are easily obtained. The power conversion efficiency, stability and reproducibility of the perovskite solar cells fabricated from the optimized mesoporous PbI2 films improved simultaneously due to the improvement in perovskite films. This work reveals the key roles of solvents (boiling point, Lewis basicity) in controlling the microstructure of the PbI2 films."
88,"This work presents an inverted planar NH2CH = NH2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cell. FAPbI3 perovskite and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by the single-step method. The perovskite films have been characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FAPbI3 solar cell with short-circuit current density (Jsc ) = 14.48 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc ) = 0.88 V, fill factor (FF) = 68%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 8.62%, respectively. "
89,"All-inorganic perovskite solar cells provide a promising solution to tackle the thermal instability problem of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an all-inorganic perovskite solar cell with novel structure (FTO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/ZnO@C60/Ag), in which ZnO@C60 bilayer was utilized as the electron-transporting layers that demonstrated high carrier extraction efficiency and low leakage loss. Consequently, the as-fabricated all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.3% with a Voc of 1.14 V, Jsc of 15.2 mA·cm–2, and FF of 0.77. The corresponding stabilized power output (SPO) of the device was demonstrated to be ∼12% and remarkably stable within 1000 s. Importantly, the obtained all-inorganic PSCs without encapsulation exhibited only 20% PCE loss with thermal treatment at 85 °C for 360 h, which largely outperformed the organic-species-containing PSCs. The present study demonstrates potential in overcoming the intractable issue concerning the thermal instability of perovskite solar cells."
90,"Sn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) featuring high performance and long-term stability are very challenging because Sn2+ is relatively prone to oxidation. Here, we have performed coadditive engineering with 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) for FASnI3-based perovskite films. From the morphological, structural, and elemental analyses, we observed that 5-AVAI affects the crystal growth of perovskites through its hydrogen bond with I– of the SnI64– octahedral. As a result, pinhole-free homogeneous and stable Sn-based perovskite films form over a large area with lower Sn4+ content. This made us able to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for Sn-based PSCs up to 7% in a 0.25 cm2 aperture area. Most importantly, the 5-AVAI added PSCs showed a record stability and maintained their initial PCE under 1 sun continuous illumination at maximum power point tracking for 100 h."
91,We report a clear correlation of the features observed in photocurrent noise-fluctuations to the performance parameters of hybrid perovskite solar cells. The general trend of increasing noise amplitude which spreads over a wider range of frequency as a function of aging is established. High-resolution spatial mapping of the photocurrent in typical devices and the associated variation of the noise spectrum confirms the underlying trend.
92,"The stability of a tin-based perovskite solar cell is a major challenge. Here, hybrid tin-based perovskite solar cells in a new series that incorporate a nonpolar organic cation, guanidinium (GA+), in varied proportions into the formamidinium (FA+) tin triiodide perovskite (FASnI3) crystal structure in the presence of 1% ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) as an additive, are reported. The device performance is optimized at a precursor ratio (GAI:FAI) of 20:80 to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.5% when prepared freshly; the efficiencies continuously increase to attain a record PCE of 9.6% after storage in a glove-box environment for 2000 h. The hybrid perovskite works stably under continuous 1 sun illumination for 1 h and storage in air for 6 days without encapsulation. Such a tin-based perovskite passes all harsh standard tests, and the efficiency of a fresh device, 8.3%, is certified. The great performance and stability of the device reported herein attains a new milestone for lead-free perovskite solar cells on a path toward commercial development."
93,"A room-temperature solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule material, termed C3, has been designed, synthesized, and incorporated between a conventional PCBM electron transport layer (ETL) and a metal electrode to function as a single-layer cathode buffer layer (CBL) for efficient planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). It has been found that C3 has a work function tunneling effect, which can decrease the work function of the Ag electrode; therefore, introduction of C3 successfully enhances the interface contact and reduces the interface barriers, which usually exist between fullerene derivatives and metal electrodes. It was also found that the C3 capping layer could improve the surface quality of PCBM, forming a smooth, dense and pinhole-free morphology with fewer surface defects. Thus, C3 can modify the interface between PCBM and Ag, enhance the diode properties of devices and facilitate electron transport through the devices; therefore, it is a very promising CBL material for PVSCs. A device with a hybrid PCBM ETL and a single cathode buffer layer of C3 exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.42% with negligible hysteresis, which was dramatically higher than that of a device based on a pure PCBM ETL. With the major advantages of a low-temperature solution process and interface modification, the excellent PCE of PVSCs on flexible substrates can exceed 13%. These results demonstrate that solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule materials can serve as high performance CBLs in PVSCs."
94,"The current work reports the concurrent passivation of interstitial and oxygen vacancy mediated defect states in low temperature processed ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) via Ultraviolet-Ozone (UVO) treatment for fabricating highly efficient (maximum efficiency: 16.70%), triple cation based MA0.57FA0.38Rb0.05PbI3 (MA: methyl ammonium, FA: formamidinium, Rb: rubidium) perovskite solar cell (PSC). Under UV exposure, ozone decomposes to free atomic oxygen and intercalates into the interstitial and oxygen vacancy induced defect sites in the ZnO lattice matrix, which contributes to suppressed trap-assisted recombination phenomena in perovskite device. UVO treatment also reduces the content of functional hydroxyl group on ZnO surface, that increases the inter-particle connectivity and grain size of perovskite film on UVO treated ZnO ETL. Owing to this, the perovskite film atop UVO treated ZnO film exhibits reduced micro-strain and dislocation density values, which contribute to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSC with modified ZnO ETL. The modified PSCs exhibit higher recombination resistance (RRec) ∼40% compared to pristine ZnO ETL based control devices. Adding to the merit, the UVO treated ZnO PSC also demonstrates superior device stability, retaining about 88% of its initial PCE in the course of a month-long, systematic degradation study."
95,"Two monomers, M:OO and M:ON, and their corresponding polymers, P:OO and P:ON, were prepared from styrene derivatives N,N-diphenyl-4-vinyl-aniline with different substituents (–OCH3 and –N(CH3)2) in the N-phenyl para positions. The polymers were synthesised and fully characterised to study their function as hole transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The thermal, optical and electrochemical properties and performance of these monomers and polymers as HTMs in PSCs were compared in terms of their structure. The polymers form more stable amorphous glassy states and showed higher thermal stability than the monomers. The different substituent in the para position influenced the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, altering the oxidation potential. Both monomers and polymers were employed as HTMs in perovskite solar cells with a device configuration FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 7.48% for M:OO, 5.14% for P:OO, 5.28% for P:ON and 3.52% for M:ON. Although showing comparatively low efficiencies, the polymers showed much superior reproducibility in comparison with Spiro-OMeTAD or the monomers, suggesting further optimisation of polymeric HTMs with redox side groups is warranted."
96,"Two-dimensionally expanded π-systems, consisting of partially oxygen-bridged triarylamine skeletons that are connected to an azulene (1–3) or biphenyl core (4), were synthesized and characterized. When tetra-substituted azulene 1 was used as a hole-transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells, the observed performance (power conversion efficiency = 16.5%) was found to be superior to that of the current HTM standard Spiro-OMeTAD. A comparison of the hole mobility, the ability to control the HOMO and LUMO levels, and the hole-collection efficiency at the perovskite/HTM interface in 1 with reference compounds (2–4 and Spiro-OMeTAD) led to the elucidation of key factors required for HTMs to act efficiently in perovskite solar cells."
97,"Due to a wide range of intriguing properties, such as efficient one-dimensional (1D) electron pathways and extraordinarily large surface areas, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube arrays are considered as the promising electron transport material for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to directly synthesize the TiO2 nanotube arrays with well-controlled geometries (e.g., diameter and height, etc.) on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Here, vertically standing TiO2 nanotube arrays with desirable heights and diameters are directly synthesized on the FTO surface by employing the aqueous TiO2 sol-gel method on tubular photoresist templates. The tube height can be precisely tailored within a range of 350–900 nm for the effective loading of perovskite precursor solution. Importantly, it is demonstrated that TiO2 nanotube arrays with the optimized tube diameter and length can facilitate the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution, and thus ensuring the formation of a dense, smooth and large grain-sized perovskite film. Moreover, the contact between the perovskite and TiO2 nanotube arrays are enhanced simultaneously. Benefiting from the high-quality perovskite film, good interfacial contact at the perovskite/TiO2 tube interface, enhanced light trapping as well as rapid electron collection and transport induced by one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes, the fabricated PVSCs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14.13%. Our work does not only demonstrate the promising potential of vertical TiO2 nanotube arrays for PVSCs, but also provides valuable insights into the design and utilization of TiO2 nanotubes for practical applications."
98,"Currently the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells is still lower than that of normal structured devices, due to the imperfect band alignment between the perovskite and hole transport layer (NiO). Herein, we found that the presence of oxygen during film preparation could lower the Fermi level of NiO and decrease the energy mismatch between the perovskite and NiO. The decreased mismatch benefited the VOC of the devices as well as the charge transfer between NiO and the perovskite. In addition, the utilization of Cs–MA–FA mixed ion-based perovskites as absorbers could increase the light response range and improve the thermal and moisture stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Finally, we achieved a stable performance output of 19.2% for inverted planar perovskite solar cells without any hysteresis."
99,"The organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells based on ternary oxide SrTiO3 shows a higher Voc, attributed to its slightly higher conduction band edge and better morphology of absorber material. However, its less efficient carrier collection and limited overall interfacial areas between the absorber material and the electron-transport layer (ETL), dramatically reducing the Jsc. Here, By adjusting the concentrations of the Ti(OBu)4, we successfully prepared the three-dimensional (3D) self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorod/SrTiO3 nanocomposites, and slightly tuned the particle size of SrTiO3. With the incorporation of the three-dimensional (3D) self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorod, the Jsc of the device based on SrTiO3 was highly boosted. The best performing solar cell we obtained exhibited a PCE of 9.99% with a Jsc of 19.48 mA/cm2. The excellent performance could be ascribed to the improvement of charge carrier collection of SrTiO3, better surface coverage and crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3, and enhanced light scattering ability caused by 3D self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorods."
100,"In PIN-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hydroscopicity and acidity of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL) have critical influences on the device stability. To eliminate these problems, Nafion, the hydrophobic perfluorosulfonic copolymer, is incorporated into PEDOT:PSS by a simple spin-coating process. For the modified film, Nafion/PSSH (poly(styrene sulfonate) acid) acts as an electron-blocking layer on the surface and the PEDOT-rich domain tends to gather into larger particles with better interchain charge transfer inside the film. Consequently, the modified PEDOT:PSS HTL shows enhanced conductivity and light transmittance as well as more favorable work function, ending up with the increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. Finally, PSCs with Nafion-modified HTLs achieve the best power conversion efficiency of 16.72%, with 23.76% improvement compared with PEDOT:PSS-only devices (13.51%). Most importantly, the device stability is obviously enhanced because of the hydrophobicity and chemical and mechanical stability of the Nafion polymer that is enriched on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film"
101,"Expensive and energy-consuming vacuum process of metal deposition with ambient-unstable hole transporters are incompatible with large-scale and low-cost production of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and thus hampers their commercialization. For the first time, we demonstrate cost-effective novel carbon nanotube (CNT) paste that was applied to FTO substrate by the facile doctor blade method and processed at low temperature (100 °C). Herein we report a new method of cost-efficient perovskite solar cells with the use of conventional hole transporters by directly clamping a selective hole extraction electrode made of CNT and a TiO2/perovskite photoanode. Most importantly, under optimized conditions in the absence of an organic hole-transporting material and metal contact, CH3NH3PbI3 and CNTs formed a solar cell with an efficiency of up to 7.83%. The PSC devices are fabricated in air without high-vacuum deposition which simplifies the processing and lowers the threshold of both scientific research and industrial production of PSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates good charge transport characteristics of CEs on the photovoltaic performance of devices. The PSCs exhibited good stability over 50 h. The abundance, low cost, and excellent properties of the CNT material offer wide prospects for further applications in PSCs."
102,"We obtain a novel kind of highly-conductive, low-temperature and perovskite-compatible carbon paste treated with the functional additives of titanium (IV) isopropoxide and acetic acid. The functional additives in the carbon paste can in si-tu generate newly complex polymeric Ti-O-Ti species acting as binder and plasticizer. It helps the electrical conductivity of carbon film increase to 1.13 × 104 S m−1, which corresponds to a sheet resistance of 4 Ω □−1 for a typical 20 μm film, superior to the transparent FTO/ITO electrode (15 Ω □−1). Then the carbon film is applied as the low-temperature carbon electrode into fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells and a champion efficiency of 14.04% is achieved. Meanwhile, the series resistance of device based on low-temperature carbon electrode can be reduced from 21 to 13 Ω cm2, compared to device based on high temperature carbon electrode only. This low-temperature, low cost, highly-conductive carbon film shows promising application in the future module design of fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells."
103,"Organic–inorganic lead perovskites have shown great promise as photovoltaic materials, and within this class of materials (CH3NH3)PbI3–xClx is of particular interest. Herein we use soft X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the methylammonium cations in a typical photovoltaic layer may dissociate into a metastable arrangement of CH3I–Pb2 defects and trapped NH3. The possibility that other metastable configurations of the organic components in (CH3NH3)PbI3–xClx is rarely considered but adds an entirely new dimension in understanding the charge trapping, ionic transport, and structural degradation mechanisms in these materials. Understanding the influence of these other configurations is of critical importance for further improving the performance of these photovoltaics."
104,"In this study, we developed the universal encapsulation method using poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) to improve the water stability of perovskite solar cells. In order to enhance the moisture barrier property, we utilized SiO2 and graphene oxide (GO) fillers in the EVOH matrix. First, UV-treated SiO2 increased the dispersibility in the EVOH matrix and made the penetrating path more complicated, which led to a better moisture barrier property. The water vapor transmission ratio (WVTR) is enhanced from 4.72 × 10–2 (EVOH only) to 1.55 × 10–2 (EVOH with SiO2 filler) g/m2 day. Second, we found that GO reduce the unreacted hydroxyl groups that could attract water molecules at the surface of EVOH. The addition of GO increased the WVTR up to 3.34 × 10–3 g/m2 day. Finally, our EVOH-based film successfully encapsulated without the efficiency drop. The encapsulated devices surprisingly maintained 86% of their performance even under direct contact with water for 5 h."
105,"Despite their excellent power conversion efficiency, MAPbI3 solar cells exhibit strong hysteresis that hinders reliable device operation. Herein it is shown that ionic motion is the dominant mechanism underlying hysteresis of MAPbI3 solar cells by studying the effects of electrical poling in different temperature ranges. Complete suppression of the hysteresis below 170 K is consistent with temperature activated diffusion of I− anions and/or the motion of the MA+ cations. Ionic motion has important effect on the overall efficiency of the MAPbI3 solar cells: the initial decrease of the power conversion efficiency while lowering the operating temperature is recovered and even enhanced up to 20% of its original value by applying an electrical poling. The open circuit voltage significantly increases and the current density fully recovers due to the reduction of the electron extraction barrier at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface driven by the charge accumulation at the interface. Moreover, beside TiO2/MAPbI3 interfacial charge transfer, charge transport in TiO2 strongly affects the photovoltaic performance, as revealed by MAPbI3/ms-TiO2 field effect transistors. These results establish the basis to develop effective strategies to mitigate operational instability of perovskites solar cells."
106,"Metal-halide based perovskite solar cells have rapidly emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic and thin-film photovoltaics. Although charge transport layers are used on either side of perovskite absorber layers to extract photogenerated electrons and holes, the time scales for charge extraction and recombination are poorly understood. Ideal charge transport layers should facilitate large discrepancies between charge extraction and recombination rates. Here, we demonstrate that highly enriched semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films enable rapid (sub-picosecond) hole extraction from a prototypical perovskite absorber layer and extremely slow back-transfer and recombination (hundreds of microseconds). The energetically narrow and distinct spectroscopic signatures for charges within these SWCNT thin films enables the unambiguous temporal tracking of each charge carrier with time-resolved spectroscopies covering many decades of time. The efficient hole extraction by the SWCNT layer also improves electron extraction by the compact titanium dioxide electron transport layer, which should reduce charge accumulation at each critical interface. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of thin interface layers of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes between the perovskite absorber layer and a prototypical hole transport layer improves device efficiency and stability, and reduces hysteresis."
107,"Anomalous current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in perovskite (PSK) solar cell is open to dispute, where hysteresis is argued to be due to electrode polarization, dipolar polarization, and/or native defects. However, a correlation between those factors and J–V hysteresis is hard to be directly evaluated because they usually coexist and are significantly varied depending on morphology and crystallinity of the PSK layer, selective contacts, and device architecture. In this study, without changing morphology and crystallinity of PSK layer in a planar heterojunction structure employing FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3, a correlation between J–V hysteresis and trap density is directly evaluated by means of thermally induced PbI2 regulating trap density. Increase in thermal annealing time at a given temperature of 150 °C induces growth of PbI2 on the PSK grain surface, which results in significant reduction of nonradiative recombination. Hysteresis index is reduced from 0.384 to 0.146 as the annealing time is increased from 5 to 100 min due to decrease in the amplitude of trap-mediated recombination. Reduction of hysteresis by minimizing trap density via controlling thermal annealing time leads to the stabilized PCE of 18.84% from the normal planar structured FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 PSK solar cell."
108,"The toxicity and the instability of lead-based perovskites might eventually hamper the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Here, we present the optoelectronic properties and stability of a two-dimensional layered (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4 perovskite. This material has a low Eg of 1.81 eV and high absorption coefficient of ∼1 × 105 cm–1 at the most intensive absorption at 539 nm, implying that it is suitable for light-harvesting in thin film solar cells, especially in tandem solar cells. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirm the high stability toward humidity, heat, and ultraviolet light. Initial studies produce a mesoscopic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 0.2%. Our work may offer some useful inspiration for the further investigation of environment-friendly and stable organic–inorganic perovskite photovoltaic materials."
109,"Organo-metal halide perovskites (OMHPs) are materials with attractive properties for optoelectronics. They made a recent introduction in the photovoltaics world by methylammonium (MA) lead triiodide and show remarkably improved charge separation capabilities when chloride and bromide are added. Here we show how halide substitution in OMHPs with the nominal composition CH3NH3PbI2X, where X is I, Br, or Cl, influences the morphology, charge quantum yield, and local interaction with the organic MA cation. X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence data demonstrate that halide substitution affects the local structure in the OMHPs with separate MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 phases. Raman spectroscopies as well as theoretical vibration calculations reveal that this at the same time delocalizes the charge to the MA cation, which can liberate the vibrational movement of the MA cation, leading to a more adaptive organic phase. The resonance Raman effect together with quantum chemical calculations is utilized to analyze the change in charge transfer mechanism upon electronic excitation and gives important clues for the mechanism of the much improved photovoltage and photocurrent also seen in the solar cell performance for the materials when chloride compounds are included in the preparation."
110,"A flexible, saddle-like, π-conjugated skeleton composed of four fused thiophene rings forming a cyclooctatetrathiophene (CoTh) with four triphenylamines (CoTh-TTPA) is presented as a hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells. The new HTM shows a bright red color stemming from a direct conjugation between the TPA groups and the central CoTh scaffold. This results in a charge transfer band due to the combination of the weak acceptor moiety, the CoTh unit, and the electron-donating p-methoxytriphenylamine groups. CoTh-TTPA exhibits a suitable highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level in relation to the valence band edge of the perovskite, which ensures efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. It has been applied as the HTM in combination with a mixed perovskite ([FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15) and a state-of-the-art triple cation perovskite ([(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08) reaching noticeable light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of 16.3 and 15.9%, respectively. These values are slightly lower than those measured for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The HTM properties have been analyzed by means of photoluminescence and conductivity experiments, which demonstrated a better hole extraction and conductivity for spiro-OMeTAD."
111,"Electron-transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface modification plays a key task for producing efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, interfacial modification of compact TiO2 using novel, one-step hydrothermally synthesized single-crystalline anatase (AT) titania nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) (average diameter = 6–10 nm) was applied as an ETL bilayer to enhance the efficient charge generation and extraction and eliminate the electron–hole recombination ratio. We report here an easy approach for enhancing the performance of planar PSCs by introducing a compact TiO2/AT TiO2 NPs bilayer through spray pyrolysis (SP) deposition and spin-coating (SC) techniques, respectively. The enhanced performance of the devices with an SP-TiO2/SC-AT TiO2 NPs bilayer facilitated more efficient electron transport, charge extraction, and low interfacial recombination. Ultimately, the best device had a 17.05% power conversion efficiency resulting from the significant decrease in J–V hysteresis, presenting almost a 12% performance improvement compared to the TiO2 only layer-based counterpart. Thus, the present study provides an important advance to the design of photovoltaic devices with respect to charge transport and electron–hole recombination."
112,"Two hole-extraction materials (HEMs), TPP-OMeTAD and TPP-SMeTAD, have been developed to facilitate the fabrication of efficient p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). By replacing the oxygen atom on HEM with sulfur (from TPP-OMeTAD to TPP-SMeTAD), it effectively lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital of the molecule and provides stronger PbS interaction with perovskites, leading to efficient charge extraction and surface traps passivation. The TPP-SMeTAD-based PVSCs exhibit both improved photovoltaic performance and reduced hysteresis in p-i-n PVSCs over those based on TPP-OMeTAD. This work not only provides new insights on creating perovskite-HEM heterojunction but also helps in designing new HEM to enable efficient organic–inorganic hybrid PVSCs."
113,"In this report, we demonstrate that moisture/O2 in ambient air is the major issue for the photovoltaic performance degradation and severe photocurrent hysteresis of non-encapsulated planar-perovskite solar cells. Consequently, this leads to difficulty in determining the real power conversion efficiency (PCE). Upon longer storage time, the evidence of a small amount of iodine in the hole transport layer (HTL) led to hindering the charge transport from the HTL to the anode, thus resulting in the decrease of short-circuit current density and fill factor. Meanwhile, the transient chronoamperometry result suggests that the increase of hysteresis with storage time is ascribed to the changes of activation energy. It is further supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile analysis, which revealed that penetration of moisture/O2 caused the shifts of iodine distribution within the perovskite layer after aging time of >72 h. Remarkably, effective moisture/O2 passivation can be achieved by combination of polyimide and UV-cured polymer as a novel encapsulation process, which exhibited an impressive stabilized PCE of above 14% (retained 97% of its initial efficiency) and simultaneously maintained the hysteresis up to ∼1000 h."
114,"Organolead halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I and Br) have attracted considerable attention since they were first used in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009.1 Park et al.2 conducted a pioneer work on solid-state solar cells with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals in 2012. In the same year, Snaith et al.3 also gained a breakthrough achievement on solid-state solar cells with an insulating Al2O3 layer. Afterwards, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells with CH3NH3PbX3, called perovskite solar cells (PSCs), rapidly increased to more than 22%"
115,"Recently, Pb-based organometal halide perovskite solar cells have passed 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the main issue hampering commercialization is toxic Pb contained in these cells. Therefore, great attention is devoted to replace Pb by less harmful metals such as Bi. Yet, the most efficient methylammonium bismuth iodide (MBI) perovskite solar cells reported in literature reach PCE up to 0.2%. In this work, MBI perovskite solar cells, which are processed by spin-coating under inert nitrogen atmosphere, employing a standard non-inverted stack are presented. The control of perovskite morphology by modifying the process has been highlighted and the impact on photovoltaic (PV) characteristics has been shown. It is observed that the concentration of the perovskite solution (0.15–0.30 M) has a huge impact on the crystallite size, and the rotation speed during the spin-coating process determines the layer coverage. Exposure of MBI solar cells to ambient air is found to be essential to obtain the highest short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage. The PCE increases over time, from 0.004% directly after processing up to 0.17% after 48 h. The fabricated cells exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V, which is the highest value published for this type of solar cell."
116,"Low-temperature-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those fabricated on flexible substrates, exhibit device performance that is worse than that of high-temperature-processed PSCs. One of the main reasons for the inferior performance of low-temperature-processed PSCs is the loss of photogenerated electrons in the electron collection layer (ECL) or related interfaces, i.e., indium tin oxide/ECL and ECL/perovskite. Here, we report that tailoring of the energy level and electron transporting ability in oxide ECLs using Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and quantum dots notably minimizes the loss of photogenerated electrons in the low-temperature-fabricated flexible PSC. The proposed ECL with methylammonium lead halide [MAPb(I0.9Br0.1)3] leads to fabrication of significantly improved flexible PSCs with steady-state power conversion efficiency of 16.0% under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm–2 intensity. These results provide an effective method for fabricating high-performance, low-temperature solution-processed flexible PSCs."
117,"Four novel benzotriazole-based donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) type hole transport materials (HTMs) BTA1-2 and DT1-2 are synthesized to investigate the effect of the acceptors on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The acceptors include nonfused core (thiophene-benzotriazole-thiophene) and fused core (dithienopyrrolobenzotriazole, DTBT). Systematical investigation reveals that the acceptor greatly influences the absorption, energy level, hole transfer and extraction, and photovoltaic performances of the HTMs. The dopant-free HTMs DT1-2 with DTBT core exhibit better hole transfer and extraction performance, and then obtain better photovoltaic performance than that of BTA1-2. Especially, the PSC using DT2 without any dopants obtains a power conversion efficiency of 13.22%, which is outperforming than that of spiro-OMeTAD (10.41%). When doping with Li-TFSI/TBP (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide/tert-butylpyridine), DT2-based cell achieves an improved efficiency of 15.77%. In addition, the different alkoxyl chain lengths on triphenylamine has a significant impact on the conductivity, hole mobility, hole extraction, and photovoltaic performance. The stability testing of the PSCs shows that the four HTMs based devices display improved stability than spiro-OMeTAD. These results certify that the fused acceptor core DTBT is a promising core for efficient D-A-D type HTMs towards PSCs."
118,"Conventional materials for gas/vapor sensing are limited to a single probe detection ability for specific analytes. However, materials capable of concurrent detection of two different probes in their respective harmful levels and using two types of sensing modes have yet to be explored. In particular, the concurrent detection of uncomfortable humidity levels and CO2 concentration (400–5000 ppm) in confined spaces is of extreme importance in a great variety of fields, such as submarine technology, aerospace, mining, and rescue operations. Herein, we report the deliberate construction and performance assessment of extremely sensitive sensors using an interdigitated electrode (IDE)-based capacitor and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as transducing substrates. The unveiled sensors are able to simultaneously detect CO2 within the 400–5000 ppm range and relative humidity levels below 40 and above 60%, using two fluorinated metal–organic frameworks, namely, NbOFFIVE-1-Ni and AlFFIVE-1-Ni, fabricated as a thin film. Their subtle difference in a structure–adsorption relationship for H2O and CO2 was analyzed to unveil the corresponding structure–sensing property relationships using both QCM- and IDE-based sensing modes."
119,"Electrochemical benzylation of [60]fullerene-fused lactones with different motifs unexpectedly affords three types of ring-opened benzylated adducts under different conditions. Both [60]fullerene-fused δ- and γ-lactones can be benzylated to generate ring-opened mono- and bis-benzylated adducts in good yields. In addition, representative fullerene products have been applied as efficient electron-transport materials in perovskite solar cells."
120,"High efficiency and long-term stability are vital for further development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs based on cesium lead halide perovskites exhibit better stability but lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), compared with organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. Lower PCE is likely associated with trap defects, overgrowth of partial crystals and irreversible phase transition in the films. Here we introduce a strategy to fabricate high-efficiency CsPbBr3-based PSCs by controlling the ratio of CsBr and PbBr2 to form the perovskite derivative phases (CsPb2Br5/Cs4PbBr6) via a vapor growth method. Following post-annealing, the perovskite derivative phases as nucleation sites transform to the pure CsPbBr3 phase accompanied by crystal rearrangements and retard rapid recrystallization of perovskite grains. This growth procedure induced by phase transition not only makes the grain size of perovskite films more uniform, but also lowers the surface potential barrier that existsbetween the crystals and grain boundaries. Owing to the improved film quality, a PCE of 10.91% was achieved for n-i-p structured PSCs with silver electrodes, and a PCE of 9.86% for hole-transport-layer-free devices with carbon electrodes. Moreover, the carbon electrode-based devices exhibited excellent long-term stability and retained 80% of the initial efficiency in ambient air for more than 2000 h without any encapsulation."
121,"CuO nanowires (NWs) with the diameters ranging from 130 to 275 nm have been successfully prepared by electrospinning technique, followed by a calcination process. Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the structure of indium tin oxide/CuO NWs/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulphonate) (PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Bphen/Ag were designed, achieving a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.87%, which is 21% improvement compared to that of the control PSCs without CuO NWs. By the characterizations of an optical microscope, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy, it was found that CuO NWs have uniform morphology and orderly arrangement. Electrochemical impedance spectrometry and external quantum efficiency were used to reveal the effect of CuO NWs on the performance of PSCs. Compared to ZnO NWs with the same diameters and quantitative analysis based on a simple model, we conclude that the improvement of PCE by about 13% can be ascribed to the increase of the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 interface area and the remaining increase of 8% can be attributed to the higher hole mobility of the CuO NWs/PEDOT:PSS composite film. The results indicate that the efficiency of PSCs will have a significant enhancement when the optimal CuO NWs are introduced into the charge transport layer."
122,"A new small molecular hole-transporting material, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-amino]pyrene (TFAP) was synthesized and applied in CH3NH3PbI3-perovskite solar cells. A best power conversion efficiency of 19.7% with a photovoltage of 1.11 V has been achieved."
123,"Inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 has been studied as a promising alternative light-absorbing material for photovoltaic application due to its suitable band gap for converting solar light and enhanced stability toward ambient conditions compared to the organic–inorganic halide perovskite. However, the photoactive α-phase of CsPbI3 can only be stabilized at a high temperature and the phase transition from α-phase to δ-phase easily occurs at room temperature. Herein, ytterbium (III) chloride (YbCl3) as a bifunctional additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to stabilize the black α-phase, and high-quality CsPbI3 films are obtained at a temperature as low as 80 °C. Yb3+ partly replaces Pb2+ to enhance the tolerance factor and favors the formation of α-phase. The Lewis adduct complex of YbCl3·DMSO in the perovskite film can passivate the perovskite film with reduced defects and help enhance the stability of the α-phase. The YbCl3-modified planar-type α-CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells show a champion power conversion efficiency of 12.4% with an impressive stability at ambient conditions. The additive induced controlled crystallization provides a simple and promising way to improve the photovoltaic performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells."
124,"Organometal-halide perovskites continue to attract a large number of solar enthusiasts due to their intrinsic properties as promising solar absorbers with relatively low processing cost. However, commercialization of perovskite solar cells remains distant, especially in the planar perovskite configuration, because of various problems such as inconsistency, poor environmental stability, and small-scale production. In this study, we present the use of complimentary electron transporting layers (ETLs) as a highly effective approach to cover the weaknesses of individual ETLs while boosting the strengths of various ETL compositions. Heterogeneous AITO/SnO2 ETL based device demonstrates paramount efficiency of 18.90% and exhibits superior stability maintaining 93% of its initial efficiency after 25 days in the absence of encapsulation at relative humidity of 30–40%. Furthermore, the simple addition of a consistent AITO layer allows improvement in reproducibility, while the simple addition of a SnO2 layer exhibits significant enhancement in electron mobility and reduction in recombination sites at the AITO/perovskite interface. In essence, our results suggest the use of compatible heterogeneous ETLs as an appealing method to provide synergistic enhancements in various photovoltaic parameters, device stability, and also device reproducibility of planar perovskite devices."
125,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low cost and high efficiency. In general, the Au cathode, a key component in PSCs, is prepared via an uneconomic vacuum thermal deposition method. Instead, the sputtering deposition method is much more economic and faster. However, it is generally thought that the organic hole transport layer such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) can be easily damaged by the high energy plasma during the sputtering process. Thus, the performance of the PSCs greatly decreases. Herein, the structure of the planar PSCs is carefully manipulated by matching the thickness of Spiro-OMeTAD layer and the Au film. With the further engineering of the interface of the Au/Spiro-OMeTAD, the planar PSCs with the sputtered Au cathode exhibit a highly reproducible average efficiency of 17.6% ± 0.8%, with the best efficiency of 18.3%. In addition, the Cu electrode is demonstrated by the sputtering method. Finally, the Au sputter deposition is scaled up to make a high efficiency (14.7%) 10 × 10 cm2 module. This demonstrates well that the sputtering deposition of the metal cathode is an effective way for the fabrication of high efficient PSCs for future industrialization."
126,"High-performance planar-heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells based on large band-gap (1.70–1.83 eV) perovskites are demonstrated. By incorporating Cl− into the MAPb(I1-YBrY)3, the crystallinity and homogeneity of the solution-processed perovskite thin films are much improved, which results in an increased charge carrier diffusion length from ≈160 nm to ≈700–800 nm. This enhancement leads to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% in the low-temperature solution-processed PHJ devices. "
127,"Metal-halide perovskites show promise as highly efficient solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and other optoelectronic devices. Ensuring long-term stability is now a major priority. In this study, an ultrathin (2 nm) layer of polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is used to functionalize the surface of C60 for the subsequent deposition of atomic layer deposition (ALD) SnO2, a commonly used electron contact bilayer for p–i–n devices. The enhanced nucleation results in a more continuous initial ALD SnO2 layer that exhibits superior barrier properties, protecting Cs0.25FA0.75Pb(Br0.20I0.80)3 films upon direct exposure to high temperatures (200 °C) and water. This surface modification with PEIE translates to more stable solar cells under aggressive testing conditions in air at 60 °C under illumination. This type of “built-in” barrier layer mitigates degradation pathways not addressed by external encapsulation, such as internal halide or metal diffusion, while maintaining high device efficiency up to 18.5%. This nucleation strategy is also extended to ALD VOx films, demonstrating its potential to be broadly applied to other metal oxide contacts and device architectures."
128,"The ideal charge transport materials should exhibit a proper energy level, high carrier mobility, sufficient conductivity, and excellent charge extraction ability. Here, a novel electron transport material was designed and synthesized by using a simple and facile solvothermal method, which is composed of the core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles. Thanks to the good match between the energy level of the SnO2 shell and the high electron mobility of the core ZnO nanoparticles, the PCE of inorganic perovskite solar cells has reached 14.35% (JSC: 16.45 mA cm–2, VOC: 1.11 V, FF: 79%), acting core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles as the electron transfer layer. The core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles size is 8.1 nm with the SnO2 shell thickness of 3.4 nm, and the electron mobility is seven times more than SnO2 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the uniform core–shell ZnO@SnO2 nanoparticles is extremely favorable to the growth of inorganic perovskite films. These preliminary results strongly suggest the great potential of this novel electron transfer material in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells."
129,"Methylammonium bismuth iodide ((CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, MBI) is a promising alternative to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its air stability and low-toxicity. Herein, a two-stage electric-field-assisted reactive deposition method has been introduced to prepare MBI films for the first time. PSCs based on MBI films were fabricated and characterized. The influences of electric parameters (applied voltage mode, pulse and time, etc.) on the morphology and crystal structure of MBI film correlated with the photovoltaic performance of PSCs have also been investigated systematically in detail. Through adjusting the voltage mode, crystal growth can be completely controlled, leading to a compact MBI film with large grain size. Moreover, the MBI film prepared by electrochemical deposition required no annealing. This work determined that the optimal performance of PSCs is based on the MBI film deposited by square-wave (AC) voltage mode (−7.3 V/+1 V, 5 Hz, 5 min). All devices exhibited long-term stability in ambient air (humidity of >50%) for more than 300 h. This study will inspire further research on the application of electrochemical deposition technique for other lead-free PSCs."
130,"Carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing interests due to low cost and excellent tolerances toward moisture, temperature, oxygen and ultraviolet light. However, carrier recombination of CsPbBr3 film and large energy level differences at CsPbBr3/carbon interface are still the most crucial problem for further enhancement of power conversion efficiency. In the current study, an intermediate energy level at CsPbBr3/carbon interface and CsPbBr3 film passivation are employed by coating hexane solution of CsPbBrxI3-x nanocrystals (NCs) on the perovskite layer. Through systematic study on interfacial engineering, it is found that CsPbBrxI3-x NCs with tunable energy level can remarkably reduce energy loss and hexane under passivation treatment can enlarge perovskite grain size as well as reduce trap state density. A champion power conversion efficiency of 9.45% is achieved for CsPbI3 NCs tailored all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC in comparison with 5.26% for NCs-free device, with the unencapsulated carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSC exhibiting remarkable long-term stability over 900 h in 80% relative humidity air atmosphere at 25 °C. This work provides an effective approach to promote charge extraction and reduce defect states density as well as enhance the performance of PSCs."
131,"Self-powered electrofluorochromic devices (EFCDs) have attracted particular attention for smart windows of green buildings. In this work, we report a perovskite solar cell (PSC) driven self-powered EFCD. For the first time, electrochromic material polyoxometalates (POMs) and a fluorescent component are made into wet adhesives. A special design feature is that POMs and magnesium composed a battery powering the EFCD bleaching, and the device can be quickly coloured after connecting with the PSCs by the electrical power generated through solar energy conversion. Therefore, without any additional external bias, the fabricated EFCD undergoes an electrochromic transition from white semitransparent to dark blue-tinted, and under UV it presents reversible fluorescence switching between yellow and dark."
132,"wo organic-inorganic halide CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared in the same experimental batch but having different power conversion efficiencies −18.46% and 17.15%—were investigated based on the absolute electroluminescence (EL) efficiency measurements and traditional I-V measurements. The possible factors that affect the power conversion efficiency were also investigated. Comparing the experimental I-V curves of the two solar cells, it was found that the short-circuit currents (Jsc) were nearly the same; however, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) were markedly different. Moreover, the deduced I-V curves from the absolute EL efficiencies of the two solar cells, which were mainly affected by the material quality, were almost the same, proving that the device processing technology has a vital effect on Voc."
133,"Herein, we demonstrate a novel two-terminal perovskite/silicon mechanical tandem solar cell, fabricated by bonding a silicon cell upside down on a perovskite cell using a transparent conductive adhesive (TCA). The TCA consists of Ag-coated poly(methyl 2-methylpropenoate) microparticles embedded in a polymer adhesive. The Ag microparticles serve as an electrical current path, and the polymer adhesive mechanically bonds two sub-cells. The specific contact resistance and transmittance of the TCA layer were determined to be 5.46 × 10−2 Ω∙cm2 and >97.0%, respectively. Through an optical simulation, the current of the perovskite top cell was predicted to match the current of the p-type Si bottom cell with an Al back-surface field (BSF) layer when the thickness of MAPbI3 was 150 nm. The tandem cell fabricated under the optimal current matching conditions exhibited a current density of 15.43 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V, and a fill factor of 79%, resulting in a steady-state efficiency of 19.4%. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the highest efficiency among two-terminal mechanical perovskite/silicon tandem cells. The unique structure of this tandem cell facilitates an excellent long-term stability without encapsulation in humid environment."
134,"Sn-doped TiO2 films are successfully co-electrodeposited from a single bath containing TiCl3 and SnCl2, providing a new and facile method for the preparation of metal-doped TiO2 thin films. Through systematic examinations on the film morphologies, optical, and electronic properties of the electrodeposited TiO2 films with different Sn-doping amount, it is utilized as the electron-transporting layer (ETL) in a perovskite solar cell (PSC). The photovoltaic performance of PSCs equipped with electrodeposited Sn-doped TiO2 ETL is improved considerably, which is mainly attributed to the increased carrier concentration and improved electron extraction capability due to Sn-doping. Currently, power conversion efficiency of planar-type PSC using 5% (molar ratio) Sn-doped TiO2 ETL achieves 16.8%, corresponding to a 9.8% improvement when comparing with the sample using pure TiO2 (15.3%)."
135,"Amelioration of the mobility and, in particular, the thermal stability of a hole-transporting molecular semiconductor is a practicable strategy to attain the enhancement of both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational durability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here a cost-effective double-[4]helicene-based molecular semiconductor (DBC-OMeDPA) is synthesized for a solution-deposited thin film, exhibiting an improved hole mobility in comparison with state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD control. X-ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation reveal the three-dimensional molecular stacking and multidirectional hole-transporting property of DBC-OMeDPA, clarifying the microscopic mechanism of the hole-transport process. A better PCE of 22% at the AM 1.5G conditions is achieved for PSCs with DBC-OMeDPA as the hole-transporter. Moreover, PSCs using DBC-OMeDPA characteristic of an elevated intrinsic glass transition temperature of 154 °C maintain a stable PCE output for hundreds of hours at 60 °C under equivalent full sunglight soaking."
136,"Forming a 2D capping layer has been recognized as an effective strategy to improve both efficiency and stability of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells. However, constructing a 2D/3D heterostructure is difficult for inorganic perovskites due to their resistance to cation exchange reaction. Here, we report an effective in situ growth method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure for inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. The 2D capping layer was found to form a type-II heterojunction with 3D perovskites, facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/hole transport layer interface. When exposed to a humid environment, the 2D/3D perovskite films showed greatly enhanced phase stability as compared to the pristine 3D perovskite films. As a result, the optimized 2D/3D CsPbI2Br device reached a power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with improved short-circuit current and significantly enhanced device moisture stability."
137,"Uniform and pinhole-free organic lead halide perovskite films in a large area are of paramount importance for achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar modules (PSMs). To obtain such high-quality perovskite films in a large area, one commonly needs to prepare a perovskite intermediate phase, in which coordinated solvent number (CSN) seems to be a key parameter. However, the CSN is difficult to measure and control. To understand the relationship between the CSN and perovskite film quality, in situ evolution of the intermediate phase is investigated. The CSN in the intermediate phase film is measured by the high-accuracy balance. Uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films are reproducibly formed by tuning the CSN in the intermediate phase film with a mixed antisolvent of ethyl acetate (EA) and toluene (Tol) blended with a 1:1 volume ratio. A hole conductor–free PSM (10 × 10 cm2) thus fabricates and, based on printable carbon electrode, achieves a PCE of 10.2% in 52 cm2 active area. This effective method provides a promising direction for developing high-quality and large-area perovskite films for photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications."
138,"All-inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskites (CsPbI3) are promising wide-bandgap materials for use in the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, but they easily undergo a phase transition from a cubic black phase to an orthorhombic yellow phase under ambient conditions. It is shown that this phase transition is triggered by moisture that causes distortion of the corner-sharing octahedral framework ([PbI6]4−). Here, a novel strategy to suppress the octahedral tilting of [PbI6]4− units in cubic CsPbI3 by systematically controlling the steric hindrance of surface organic terminal groups is provided. This steric hindrance effectively prevents the lattice distortion and thus increases the energy barrier for phase transition. This mechanism is verified by X-ray diffraction measurements and density functional theory calculations. Meanwhile, the formation of an organic capping layer can also passivate the surface electronic trap states of perovskite absorber. These modifications contribute to a stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% for the inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is the highest efficiency achieved by the inverted-structure inorganic PSCs. More importantly, the optimized devices retained 85% of their initial PCE after aging under ambient conditions for 30 days"
139,"For commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the device stability issues attributed to degradation of perovskite material, photo and thermal instability, and photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis behavior should be solved. Furthermore, most of presented high efficiency PSCs utilize an antisolvent-strategy to assist perovskite crystal growth with large grain-size and excellent coverage. To solve such issues, we developed fully-ambient-air and antisolvent-free processes for the fabrication of PSCs with perovskite-based composites (i.e., MAPbI3-xClx-Cu:NiO, MAPbI3-xClx-Cu:NiO-carbon-graphite and MAPbI3-xClx-Al2O3). Such perovskite composites based cells with interface engineering yielded high power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 18.6% and fill factor (FF) of 78.3% with excellent reproducibility. More importantly, the target cells showed hysteresis-free behavior and dramatic enhancement in air-, photo- and thermal-stability. Compared to the pristine cells, the target device showed remarkable long-term stability with retaining almost 100% of the initial values of Voc and Jsc, and ~94% of FF and PCE over 280 days."
140,"Low-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (LDRP) perovskites are a current theme in solar energy research as researchers attempt to fabricate stable photovoltaic devices from them. However, poor exciton dissociation and insufficiently fast charge transfer slows the charge extraction in these devices, resulting in inferior performance. 1,4-Butanediamine (BEA)-based low-dimensional perovskites are designed to improve the carrier extraction efficiency in such devices. Structural characterization using single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that these layered perovskites are formed by the alternating ordering of diammonium (BEA2+) and monoammonium (MA+) cations in the interlayer space (B-ACI) with the formula (BEA)0.5MAn PbnI3n+1. Compared to the typical LDRP counterparts, these B-ACI perovskites deliver a wider light absorption window and lower exciton binding energies with a more stable layered perovskite structure. Additionally, ultrafast transient absorption indicates that B-ACI perovskites exhibit a narrow distribution of quantum well widths, leading to a barrier-free and balanced carrier transport pathway with enhanced carrier diffusion (electron and hole) length over 350 nm. A perovskite solar cell incorporating BEA ligands achieves record efficiencies of 14.86% for (BEA)0.5MA3Pb3I10 and 17.39% for (BEA)0.5Cs0.15(FA0.83MA0.17)2.85Pb3(I0.83Br0.17)10 without hysteresis. Furthermore, the triple cations B-ACI devices can retain over 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency when stored under ambient atmospheric conditions for 2400 h and show no significant degradation under constant illumination for over 500 h."
141,"Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their booming power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is usually limited by the quality of the perovskite film. Here, trace polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution as an additive for the crystalline defect passivation. The PVP with carbonyl delays the transition of the perovskite from the δ-phase to α-phase, which slows down the crystallization process. Thus, the crystallization rate of the α-phase perovskite can be controlled by forming coordination and a better film quality is achieved. As a result, we achieve a champion PCE of 19.63%, which is much higher than the 17.47% of the reference PSC. This study shows the mechanism of the material quality improvement by the additive during the perovskite film formation, where three processes are proposed to describe the film crystallization. We prove that the addition of PVP is an effective approach to improve the quality of the perovskite film, providing a valuable guidance for the development of high efficiency PSCs."
142,"All-inorganic CsPbBr3 is attracting tremendous attentions in photovoltaic field due to its superior stability. However, CsPbBr3 perovskite always suffers from a poor crystallinity and film morphology. Many efforts have been paid on the CsBr deposition process to improve the film quality, while few attentions are paid on the crystallization kinetics of the PbBr2 framework film. Here, we demonstrate a novel antisolvent-washing strategy for the PbBr2 film for the first time to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 film. This technique has a significant impact on the nucleation and growth of PbBr2 crystals. As-prepared CsPbBr3 films exhibit more homogeneous with higher crystallinity and coverage as well as larger grain sizes compared to those untreated ones. The best-performing antisolvent-treated perovskite solar cell achieves a scanned power conversion efficiency of 8.55%, which is an excellent efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 cells reported yet. This enhancement can be mainly attributed to the more effective charge transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination caused by the reduced defect densities. Moreover, our devices show superb stability when stored in air for 1000 h and upon persistent thermal attack at 80 °C. Our work provides a new train of thought for controlling the growth dynamics and film morphology of CsPbBr3 films."
143,"We developed lead halide perovskite quantum dot (QD) solar cells with a combinational absorbing layer based on stacked α-CsPbI3 and FAPbI3. α-CsPbI3 QDs, with a relatively wide bandgap of 1.75 eV, are not ideal for single-junction solar cells. We show that the absorption can be broadened by the introduction of another QD layer with a narrower bandgap like FAPbI3. The α-CsPbI3/FAPbI3 structure together with thermal annealing can improve the electrical coupling in the FAPbI3 layer and induce A-site cation exchange to develop a graded heterojunction for more efficient charge extraction. A highest power conversion efficiency of 15.6% and improved ambient stability have been achieved for the bilayer structured solar cells. More interestingly, the perovskite QDs provided a facile way to fabricate multiple layers and quantum junctions for optoelectronic applications via layer-by-layer deposition, which cannot be realized in solution-processed perovskite thin-film devices."
144,"Computational, thin-film deposition, and characterization approaches have been used to investigate the all-inorganic lead-free CsBi3I10 as a candidate to act as a thin-film photovoltaic absorber. In this paper, CsBi3I10 was firstly predicted with a layer crystal structure of stable hexagonal phase-like Cs3Bi2I9 and then prepared by one-step coating also showing the high purity hexagonal phase and crystallinity, very consistent with the theoretical calculation. After solvent annealing, a high absorption coefficient of approximately 105 cm–1 in visible light and a suitable optical band gap of 1.78 eV were obtained for the CsBi3I10 thin film. The solar cell based on the CsBi3I10 perovskite thin film exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 1.05%, good reproducibility, hysteresis-free behavior, and long-term stability. These results indicate that the performance of all-inorganic Pb-free perovskite solar cells can be further improved."

146,"High efficiency for H2 production: a single perovskite solar cell is demonstrated to drive three reformed electrolyzers in series for hydrogen production by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction at anode with the hydrazine oxidation reaction. Furthermore, careful matching of the operating point of the reformed electrolysis cell with the maximum power point of photovoltaic device results in an impressively high solar-to-fuel efficiency. "
147,"Reduced-dimensional hybrid perovskite semiconductors have recently attracted significant attention due to their promising stability and optoelectronic properties. However, the issue of poor charge transport in 2D perovskites limits its application. Here, studies on intermediate-controlled crystal growth are reported to improve charge carrier transport in 2D perovskite thin films. It is shown that the coordination strength of solvents with perovskite precursor affects the initial state of intermediate phase formation as well as the subsequent perovskite layer growth. Tuning the solvent composition with a mixture (5:5) of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) leads to the growth of highly orientated 2D perovskite films with much-improved optoelectronic properties (faster transport by ≈50x, longer carrier lifetime by ≈4x, and lower defect density by ≈30x) than the film prepared with pure DMF. Consequently, perovskite solar cells based on DMF/DMSO (5:5) show >80% efficiency improvement than the devices based on pure DMF."
148,"Minimization of defects and ion migration in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite films is desirable for obtaining photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability. However, achieving this target is still a challenge due to the lack of efficient multifunctional passivators. Herein, to address this issue, n-type goethite (FeOOH) quantum dots (QDs) are introduced into the perovskite light-absorption layer for achieving efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It is found that the iron, oxygen, and hydroxyl of FeOOH QDs can interact with iodine, lead, and methylamine, respectively. As a result, the crystallization kinetics process can be retarded, thereby resulting in high quality perovskite films with large grain size. Meanwhile, the trap states of perovskite can be effectively passivated via interaction with the under-coordinated metal (Pb) cations, halide (I) anions on the perovskite crystal surface. Consequently, the PSCs with FeOOH QDs achieve a high efficiency close to 20% with negligible hysteresis. Most strikingly, the long-term stability of PSCs is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, compared with the CH3NH3PbI3-based device, a higher PCE of 21.0% is achieved for the device assembled with a Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbBr0.45I2.55 perovskite layer"
149,"In this work, the effects of annealing temperature and time for one-step fabrication of mixed metal halide perovskite films were investigated. The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) improved from 8.30 to 10.85% after being annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and exhibited negligible photocurrent hysteresis when prepared at an ambient humidity of 70%. Besides, a high annealing temperature for a short time (150 °C; 1 min) shows comparable power conversion efficiency with perovskite annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The electronic properties of PSCs were characterized by photo induced charge extraction via linearly increasing the voltage (photo-CELIV), impedance, and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. Our finding suggests that the improvement in photovoltaic performance is correlated to the improved charge mobility, suppressed charge trapping, and prolonged recombination lifetime"
150,"Solvent engineering has been considered a reliable process for the fabrication of pinhole-free and highly crystalline perovskite thin films. Recently, green solvents have received immense attention, as the toxic antisolvents used in the conventional fabrication process cause environmental and health hazards. In this regard, ethyl acetate (EA) is a promising environmentally friendly antisolvent. Here, we present the fabrication of perovskites with controlled morphologies by changing the composition of the perovskite and the volume of EA in ambient humidity. The incorporation of [HC(NH2)2]PbIBr2 into a CH3NH3PbI3 matrix results in a grain size up to ~1.5 μm. This induces a considerable reduction of trap density, leading to the suppression of charge recombination and, consequently, improvement in the photoluminescence characteristics. The resulting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized devices are 20.93% and 19.51% for active areas of 0.12 cm2 and 0.7 cm2, respectively. The reduced diffusion of moisture along grain boundaries improves device stability. Further, by virtue of the excellent humidity resistance of EA, the film morphologies obtained at high relative humidity (50%) are similar to those obtained under dry conditions, exhibiting an impressive PCE of 20.11%. We believe that our optimized fabrication process using EA can be extended to other green antisolvent systems."
151,"N2,N2,N8,N8-tetrakis(4-(methylthio)phenyl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-2,8-diamine (DBTMT) is synthesized from three commercial monomers for application as a promising dopant-free hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs). The intrinsic properties (optical properties and electronic energy levels) of DBTMT are investigated, proving that DBTMT is a suitable HTM for the planar p–i–n pero-SCs. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized pero-SCs (with structure as ITO/pristine DBTMT/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Ag) reaches 21.12% with a fill factor (FF) of 83.25%, which is among the highest PCEs and FFs reported for planar p–i–n pero-SCs based on dopant-free HTMs. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra of MAPbI3 and DBTMT–MAPbI3 films demonstrate that there is an interaction between DBTMT and MAPbI3 at the interface through the sulfur atoms in DBTMT to passivate the defects, which is corresponding to the higher FF and PCE of the corresponding devic"
152,"Even though the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of plastic perovskite solar cells (P-PSCs) is increased to 18.40%, the majority of solvent systems implemented for deposition of perovskites are hazardous to handle, which will greatly hinder the future development of plastic photovoltaic devices. In this study, composition-tailored hybrid perovskite from a low-toxicity aqueous lead nitrate precursor was fabricated by regulating the conversion kinetics. We systematically investigated the interplay among NO3− and mixed cation/anion in the intermediate ion exchange and renovated the interpretation of hybrid-composition perovskite conversion. The fully ambient-processed hybrid-composition perovskite with high crystallinity and less defects was applied in a brookite TiO2 scaffold-based P-PSCs, which achieved a record-high PCE of scaffold-type P-PSC of 16.50%. The interaction of environmentally-friendly aqueous lead nitrate precursor with hybrid ions advanced the understanding of perovskite conversion mechanism and had a great potential to realize the low-toxic fabrication process by using water as a processing solvent in the ambient atmosphere."
153,"The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes is an important endeavor toward achieving high-efficiency solar energy conversion. Now, a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy is used to judiciously create an amorphous TiO2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO2 surface as an electron-transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO2, thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO2 surface. Such amorphous TiO2-coated ETL possesses an increased electron density owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Compared to pristine TiO2-based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO2 ETL exhibit an enhanced short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency"
154,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising solar energy conversion technologies owing to their rapidly developing power conversion efficiency (PCE). Low-temperature solution processing of the perovskite layer enables the fabrication of flexible devices. However, their application has been greatly hindered due to the lack of strategies to fabricate high-quality electron transport layers (ETLs) at the low temperatures (≈100 °C) that most flexible plastic substrates can withstand, leading to poor performances for flexible PSCs. In this work, through combining the spin-coating process with a hydrothermal treatment method, ligand-free and highly crystalline SnO2 ETLs are successfully fabricated at low temperature. The flexible PSCs based on this SnO2 ETL exhibit an excellent PCE of 18.1% (certified 17.3%). The flexible PSCs maintained 85% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles and over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient air for 30 days without encapsulation. The investigation reveals that hydrothermal treatment not only promotes the complete removal of organic surfactants coated onto the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles by hot water vapor but also enhances crystallization through the high vapor pressure of water, leading to the formation of high-quality SnO2 ETLs"
155,An effective approach to significantly increase the electrical conductivity of a NiOx hole-transporting layer (HTL) to achieve high-efficiency planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. Perovskite solar cells based on using Cu-doped NiOx HTL show a remarkably improved power conversion efficiency up to 15.40% due to the improved electrical conductivity and enhanced perovskite film quality. General applicability of Cu-doped NiOx to larger bandgap perovskites is also demonstrated in this study
156,"One of key factors to design applicable electron transport layers (ETLs) for perovskite solar cells is the morphology of ETLs since a good morphology would help to facilitate the carrier transport at two interfaces (perovskite\ETL and ETL\cathode). However, one drawback of most organic ETL small molecules is the internal undesired accumulation, which would cause the formation of inappropriate morphology and rough ETL surface. Here, by elaborately designing the side chains of NDI derivatives, the molecular interaction could be modified to achieve the aggregation in different degrees, which would eventually affect the accumulation of molecules and surface qualities of ETLs. By speculating from the comparison between the absorption spectra of solutions and films, the sequence of extent of molecule interaction and aggregation was built among three NDI derivatives, which is further confirmed by direct evidence of atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. Then, carrier exaction abilities are simply studied by steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. The carrier transport process is also discussed based on cyclic voltammetry, time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and mobility. NDIF1 are proven to have the appropriate internal aggregation to smooth the contact with cathode and low series resistance, and a device performance of 15.6 % is achieved. With the ability of preventing the thermal diffusion of Ag towards the perovskite surface due to the strong interaction between molecules, NDIF2 at high concentration shows the highest fill factor (80 %)"
157,"Recently, the thermally stable and facilely fabricated inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention where the electron transport layer (ETL) is vital. However, the typical sintering temperature for the widely used electron transport material, that is, TiO2, is more than 400 °C, elevating the cost and hindering the application. Due to high electron mobility and low fabrication temperature, ZnO becomes a desirable alternative for TiO2, as the ETL in CsPbIBr2 PSCs, albeit with low open-circuit voltage (Voc). Herein, this work introduces a trace of NH4Cl to the sol–gel-derived ZnO precursor to decrease the work function of the ZnO film, tune the surface morphology of the perovskite film, and thus suppress the density of trap states in the CsPbIBr2 films. Consequently, full-coverage and pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films consisting of micron-size and high-crystallinity grains are obtained. More importantly, for the optimal NH4Cl-modified ZnO, a shining improvement in Voc from 1.08 to 1.27 V boosts the champion CsPbIBr2 PSCs to obtain a power conversion efficiency of 10.16%, which is the highest value reported among pure-CsPbIBr2 PSCs under a low fabrication temperature of 160 °C. In addition, the NH4Cl-modified ZnO ETL reduces the severe hysteresis and increases the device stability significantly."
158,"The HC(NH2)2+(FA+) is a well-known substitute to CH3NH3+(MA+) for its capability to extend light utilization for improved power conversion efficiency for perovskite solar cells; unfortunately, the dark cubic phase (α-phase) can easily transition to the yellow orthorhombic phase (δ-phase) at room temperature, an issue that prevents its commercial application. In this report, an inorganic material (NbF5) is developed to stabilize the desired α-phase perovskite material by incorporating NbF5 additive into the perovskite films. It is found that the NbF5 additive effectively suppresses the formation of the yellow δ-phase in the perovskite synthesis and aging process, thus enhancing the humidity and light-soaking stability of the perovskite film. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the NbF5 additive exhibit improved air stability by tenfold, retaining nearly 80% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 50 d. In addition, under full-sun AM 1.5 G illumination of a xenon lamp without any UV-reduction, the perovskite solar cells with the NbF5 additive also show fivefold improved illumination stability than the control devices without NbF5"
159,"Reactive sputtering is a versatile technique used to form compact films with excellent homogeneity. In addition, it allows easy control over deposition parameters such as gas flow rate that results in changes on composition and thus in the film required properties. In this report, reactive sputtering is used to deposit niobium oxide films. A niobium target is used as metal source and different oxygen flow rates to deposit niobium oxide films. The oxygen flow rate was changed from 3 to 10 sccm. The films deposited under low oxygen flow rates show higher electrical conductivity and provide better perovskite solar cells when used as electron transport layer. "
160,"Hybrid organic and inorganic perovskite solar cells lack long-term stability, and this negatively impacts the widespread application of this emerging and promising photovoltaic technology. Herein, aiming to increase the stability of perovskite films based on CH3NH3PbI3 and to deeply understand the formation of 2D structures, solutions of alkylammonium chlorides containing 8, 10, and 12 carbons are introduced during the spin-coating on the surface of 3D perovskite films leading to the in situ formation of 2D structures. It is possible to identify the chemical formulae of some 2D structures formed by X-ray diffraction and UV–vis analysis of the modified films. Interestingly, the increase in the stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 films due to the formation of a 2D + 3D perovskite network is only possible in planar TiO2 substrates. The increase in stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 films follows the surfactant molecule order: octylammonium (8C) > decylammonium (1 °C) > dodecylammonium (12C) chlorides > standard. An increase of 17.6% in the lifetime of the devices assembled with octylammonium-modified perovskite film is observed compared with that of the standard device, which is directly linked to the improvement of the charge carrier lifetimes obtained from time-correlated single photon counting measurements."
161,"Based on self-assembly, novel electron extraction layers (EELs) composed of naphthalimide (NPI) derivatives are constructed for application in n-i-p perovskite solar cells. Upon molecular energy level modulation, the power conversion efficiencies have been largely improved from 5.4% to 16%. Such low-cost and highly regulable EELs are promising for future commercial applications."
162,"Two synthetic chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives named Zn-Chl and H2-Chl are examined as efficient hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). The device structure here is ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl/H2-Chl/Ag, which employs Zn-Chl/H2-Chl as the bilayer HTL. Zn-Chl and H2-Chl show different electronic absorptions, surface morphology, hole mobilities and energy levels due to their structural differences. The bilayer HTL realizes complementary performance of the Chl in each layer. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) reaches 14.1% under standard AM1.5 illumination, which is higher than that of the device with monolayer Zn-Chl (11.9%) or H2-Chl (0.16%) only. The bilayer HTL also exhibits better device stability. This is the first time that bilayer Chl has been used as a HTL in PSCs. It provides a promising method to enhance the performance of Chl-based PSCs."
163,"Four different functional groups including amino (−NH2), phosphine (−PH2), hydroxyl (−OH), and thiol (−SH) were combined with POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) molecules to investigate how functional groups affect the surface passivation of POSS systems. Results from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that functional group amino (−NH2) with adsorption energy 86 (56) kJ mol–1 is consistently better than that of thiol (−SH) with adsorption energy 68 (43) kJ mol–1 for different passivation mechanisms. Theoretical studies on the analogous POSS–OH and POSS–PH2 systems show similar adsorption energies. Two of the systems were also investigated experimentally; aminopropyl isobutyl POSS (POSS–NH2) and mercaptopropyl isobutyl POSS (POSS–SH) were applied as passivation materials for MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite and (FA)0.85(MA)0.15Pb(I3)0.85(Br3)0.15 (FA = formamidinium) perovskite films. The same conclusion was drawn based on the results from contact angle studies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the stability of solar cells in ambient atmosphere, indicating the vital importance of choice of functional groups for passivation of the perovskite materials."
164,"Due to the additional introduction of bulky organic ammonium and the competition between bulky organic ammonium and methyl ammonium in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (2DRP) perovskite, the crystallization process becomes complicated. Here, it is demonstrated that the rapid crystallization controlled by processing solvents plays an important role in achieving high-quality 2DRP perovskite films. It is found that the processing solvents, e.g., dimethylacetamide (DMAC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with a different polarity and boiling point, have almost no effect on crystal structure and phase distribution but have a remarkable effect on crystallization kinetics, crystal growth orientation, and crystallinity of 2DRP perovskite. Compared to polar aprotic solvent DMF and DMSO with a high boiling point, DMAC with low polarity and a suitable boiling point has a weak coordination to lead and ammonium salts and is easy to escape during solution processing, which is able to accelerate the crystallization rate of 2DRP perovskite. Benefitting from the rapid crystallization enabled high-quality 2DRP perovskite films, the best-performing device with improved stability and a power conversion efficiency of 12.15% is obtained using DMAC solvent. These findings may give guidance for solvent engineering for highly efficient 2DRP perovskite solar cells in the future."
165,"In this study, chlorodeoxyhydroxyethylcellulose (CDHC) was synthesized from hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) through chlorination and then both HEC and CDHC were applied individually as additives within the methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) layers of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The architecture of the PVSCs was indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate/MAPbI3:cellulose derivative/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/Ag. The photovoltaic (PV) properties of the HEC- and CDHC-incorporated PVSCs were superior to those of the corresponding pristine PVSC prepared without an additive, a result of decreases in the number of grain boundary defects as well as increases in the crystal grain sizes, crystallinities, and absorption intensities of the modified perovskite films. Moreover, the polymer chains of CDHC, presenting chlorine atoms, were particularly beneficial for enhancing the crystal size and crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film, resulting in the highest absorbance and PV performance in this study being those of a CDHC-doped PVSC. Indeed, this CDHC-incorporated PVSC displayed a short-circuit current density of 17.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V, a fill factor of 0.61, and a power conversion efficiency of 10.38%"
166,"The high cost of hole transporting materials (HTMs) and noble metal electrodes limits the application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Carbon materials have been commonly utilized for HTMs and noble-metal-free PSCs. In this paper, a more conductive 2D MXene material (Ti3C2), showing a similar energy level to carbon materials, has been used as a back electrode in HTMs and noble-metal-free PSCs for the first time. Seamless interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and Ti3C2 material was obtained using a simple hot-pressing method. After the adjustment of key parameters, the PSCs based on the Ti3C2 electrode show more stability and higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) (13.83%, 27% higher than that (10.87%) of the PSCs based on carbon electrodes) due to the higher conductivity and seamless interfacial contact of the MXene electrode. Our work proposes a promising future application for MXene and also a good electrode candidate for HTM and the noble-metal-free PSCs"
167,"Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed a rapid rising in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the past few years; however, they still suffer from recombination loss via interface defects in perovskite films. In this study, we implement an efficient phase purification strategy by incorporating isopropyl alcohol (IPA) post-treatment of perovskite films that reduces defect states and improves charge transport. It is found that the DMSO-PbI2-MAI complex in the perovskite film is eliminated after IPA post-treatment. A suit of opto-electric characterizations demonstrates that the nonradiative recombination is greatly diminished, and charge extraction is effectively boosted in the modified perovskite films. The perovskite solar cells with phase-pure MAPbI3 achieve an impressively larger PCE of 18.78% than that of 17.1% for the control devices. Our work presents a facile and efficient path to performance improvement of PSCs."
168,"Previously, benzotrithiophene (BTT)-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) had to be doped with three chemical agents for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSC). This work describes significant progress by which the first dopant-free BTT core-based HTM (YKP03) with EDOT spacers was readily accessed by step-saving direct C–H arylation. PSCs with dopant-free YKP03 showed promising efficiencies of up to 16.15% with potential long-term storage stability."
169,"It is well known that the different proportions of CuO and Cu2O in CuOx hole transfer materials have a great influence on the hole transport property as well as the device performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, we changed the content of Cu2O in the film by controlling the deposition voltage during electrodeposition, and the effects of different contents of Cu2O in the films on the device were investigated for the first time. It was found that the content of Cu2O in the film reached the highest point with the deposition voltage 0.5V, such films have the highest transmittance and carrier mobility. After assembling the device, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the champion device reached 13.48% under a one-sun AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination. Furthermore, the unpackaged device based on CuOx still retained over 75% PCE after being placed in the ambient condition (30–40% humidity, 20–30∘C) for 500h"
170,"2D perovskites have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent stability compared with 3D perovskites. However, the intrinsic hydrophilicity of introduced alkylammonium salts effects the humidity stability of 2D/3D perovskites. Devices based on longer chain alkylammonium salts show improvement in hydrophobicity but lower efficiency due to the poorer charge transport among various layers. To solve this issue, two hydrophobic short-chain alkylammonium salts with halogen functional groups (2-chloroethylamine, CEA+ and 2-bromoethylamine, BEA+) are introduced into (Cs0.1FA0.9)Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 3D perovskites to form 2D/3D perovskite structure, which achieve high-quality perovskite films with better crystallization and morphology. The optimal 2D/3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 5% CEA+ display a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 20.08% under 1 sun irradiation. Because of the notable hydrophobicity of alkylammonium cations with halogen functional groups and the formed 2D/3D perovskite structure, the optimal PSCs exhibit superior moisture resistance and retain 92% initial PCE after aging at 50 ± 5% relative humidity for 2400 h. This work opens up a new direction for the design of new-type 2D/3D PSCs with improved performance by employing proper alkylammonium salts with different functional groups."
171,"It has been reported that nonradiative charge carrier recombination in hybrid perovskite materials restricts the device performance of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we report efficient perovskite solar cells through suppressed nonradiative charge carrier recombination by a processing additive, aminopropanoic acid. It is found that aminopropanoic acid not only modulates the crystal growth processes but also minimizes the defects of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit both enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence and elongated charge carrier lifetime, indicating that nonradiative charge carrier recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films is drastically suppressed. As a result, perovskite solar cells fabricated using the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed with the addition of aminopropanoic acid exhibit approximately 15% enhanced efficiency as compared with those made with pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. All of these results demonstrate that our findings provide a facile way to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells."
172,"Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type 2D perovskites with a single organic cation layer exhibit a narrower distance between two adjacent inorganic layers compared to the corresponding Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites, which facilitates interlayer charge transport. However, the internal crystal structures in 2D DJ perovskites remain elusive. Herein, in a p-xylylenediamine (PDMA)-based DJ perovskite bearing bifunctional NH3+ spacer, the compression from confinement structure (inorganic layer number, n = 1, 2) to nonconfinement structure (n > 3) with the decrease of PDMA molar ratio is unraveled. Remarkably, the nonconfined perovskite displays shorter spacing between 2D quantum wells, which results in a lower exciton binding energy and hence promotes exciton dissociation. The significantly diminishing quantum confinement promotes interlayer charge transport leading to a maximum photovoltaic efficiency of ≈11%. Additionally, the tighter interlayer packing arising from the squeezing of inorganic octahedra gives rise to enhanced ambient stability."
173,"Producing high efficiency solar cells without high-temperature processing or use of additives still remains a challenge with the two-step process. Here, the solution processing of MAPbI3 from PbI2 films in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is investigated. In-situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements reveal a sol–gel process involving three PbI2-DMF solvate complexes—disordered (P0) and ordered (P1, P2)—prior to PbI2 formation. When the appropriate solvated state of PbI2 is exposed to MAI (methylammonium Iodide), it can lead to rapid and complete room temperature conversion into MAPbI3 with higher quality films and improved solar cell performance. Complementary in-situ optical reflectance, absorbance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements show that dry PbI2 can take up only one third of the MAI taken up by the solvated-crystalline P2 phase of PbI2, requiring additional annealing and yet still underperforming. The perovskite solar cells fabricated from the ordered P2 precursor show higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reproducibility than devices fabricated from other cases. The average PCE of the solar cells is greatly improved from 13.2(±0.53)% (from annealed PbI2) to 15.7(±0.35)% (from P2) reaching up to 16.2%. This work demonstrates the importance of controlling the solvation of PbI2 as an effective strategy for the growth of high-quality perovskite films and their application in high efficiency and reproducible solar cells"
174,"Lead halide perovskite solar cells afford high power conversion efficiencies, even though the photoactive layer is formed in a solution process. At the same time, solution processing may impose some severe dewetting issues, especially if organic, hydrophobic charge transport layers are considered. Ultimately, very narrow processing windows with a relatively large spread in device performance and a considerable lab-to-lab variation result. Here, we unambiguously identify dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which is commonly used as a co-solvent and complexing agent, to be the main reason for dewetting of the precursor solution on hydrophobic hole transport layers, such as polytriarylamine, in a gas-quenching-assisted deposition process. In striking contrast, we will show that N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon (NMP), which has a lower hydrophilic–lipophilic-balance, can be favorably used instead of DMSO to strongly mitigate these dewetting issues. The resulting high-quality perovskite layers are extremely tolerant with respect to the mixing ratio (NMP/dimethylformamide) and other process parameters. Thus, our findings afford an outstandingly robust, easy to use, and fail-safe deposition technique, yielding single (MAPbI3) and double (FA0.94Cs0.06PbI3) cation perovskite solar cells with high efficiencies (∼18.5%). Most notably, the statistical variation of the devices is significantly reduced, even if the deposition process is performed by different persons. We foresee that our results will further the reliable preparation of perovskite thin films and mitigate process-to-process variations that still hinder the prospects of upscaling perovskite solar technology."
175,"Optimal optoelectronic properties of interfacial layers in perovskite solar cells are essential for achieving high power conversion efficiency. We herein demonstrated a solution-processed spinel CuCo2O4 as a hole transport layer to use in high-performance perovskite solar cells. The solution-processed CuCo2O4 possessed high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency in UV–vis–NIR, well-matched energy levels to perovskite, and efficient hole transport capability to the perovskite layer. The optoelectronic properties of CuCo2O4 were finely controlled by optimizing the annealing temperature, leading to a 14.12% power conversion efficiency in planar perovskite solar cells. Another impressive advantage for the CuCo2O4-based hole transport layer is a negligible hysteresis of the device at very low scan rate, which brought about highly stable and reliable photovoltaic performance. All of the results studied in this work suggest a bright future for solution-processed CuCo2O4 as a novel hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and good stability."
176,"A small amount of a radical-bearing redox-active polymer, poly(1-oxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA), incorporated into the photovoltaic organo-lead halide perovskite layer significantly enhanced durability of both the perovskite layer and its solar cell and even exposure to ambient air or oxygen. PTMA acted as an eliminating agent of the superoxide anion radical formed upon light irradiation on the layer, which can react with the perovskite compound and decompose it to lead halide. A cell fabricated with a PTMA-incorporated perovskite layer and a hole-transporting polytriarylamine layer gave a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 18.8 % (18.2 % for the control without PTMA). The photovoltaic current was not reduced in the presence of PTMA in the perovskite layer probably owing to a carrier conductivity of PTMA. The incorporated PTMA also worked as a water-repelling coating for providing humidity-resistance to the organo-lead halide perovskite laye"
177,"In this study, polyethylene oxide (PEO) is introduced into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite to replace the standard anti-solvent washing process of perovskite solar cells. By forming PEO-MAPbI3 composites, we achieved controllability of the perovskite surface morphology. Furthermore, the PEO addition improved the electronic properties of the composites by suppressing the trap density of the MAPbI3 perovskite. We observed a significant increase in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) from 0.24% to 7.25% using the proper PEO-perovskite composition ratio (1.5:1), based on their fabrication without any organic anti-solvent treatment. Moreover, the performance uniformity and outdoor stability were significantly enhanced by employing the composite. The proposed PEO-perovskite composite offers a promising pathway for the industrialization of PVSCs in terms of PCE, uniformity, stability, and feasibility—without involving current anti-solvent washing process"
178,"Herein, commercially accessible SnO2 and home-made TiO2 nanoparticles as a combined electron transporting bilayer (ETBL) are applied to achieve highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). With the formed cascade-aligned energy levels from the proper stacking of SnO2 and TiO2 layers and the excellent defect-passivation ability of TiO2, SnO2/TiO2 ETBLs effectively reduce energy loss and inhibit defects formation both at the electron transporting layers (ETL)/perovskite interfaces and within the bulk of perovskite layer as revealed by a comprehensive analysis of photoelectric characteristic analysis, including ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Consequently, the PSC devices acquired a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.50% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 24.2 mA cm−2 and an fill factor of 77%, which are superior to the values of the control device based on single SnO2 layer with a PCE of 18.09% (a 13.3% boosting on PCE). Moreover, there was no degradation after 49 days, indicating the great stability after adding TiO2 layer. Herein, it is demonstrated that the cascaded alignment of energy levels between the electrode and perovskite layer by ETBLs could be an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with excellent long-term stability."
179,"PEDOT:PSS is widely used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the most popular hole transporting layer (HTL). However, p-i-n type inverted planar PSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL typically exhibit up to 200 mV more voltage loss compared to conventional planar PSCs (n-i-p) that generally show open circuit voltages (VOC) of around 1.1 V. In this study, we develop a simple, inexpensive and effective interfacial engineering strategy by doping PEDOT:PSS with cesium iodide (CsI) to reduce the voltage loss and achieve highly efficient inverted PSCs. SEM, AFM, and XPS measurements suggest that CsI modifies the interface between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite by reacting with PbI2 to form CsPbI3, thus facilitating interfacial contact and charge transport. Moreover, after CsI-modification (CsI-PEDOT:PSS), the hole transport properties of PEDOT:PSS and the hole extraction are enhanced, while the energy levels are more favorable and charge recombination is suppressed. Importantly, compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS that suffers from a large non-radiative recombination loss (0.375 V), CsI-PEDOT:PSS makes the device to realize an impressively low non-radiative voltage loss (only 0.287 V). As a result, inverted PSCs based on CsI-PEDOT:PSS show a small voltage loss, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.22%, and no hysteresis and achieve a high VOC (1.084 V), while the control device without CsI shows an inferior efficiency of 16.57%. Both the high VOC and PCE are an improvement over literature data on modified PEDOT:PSS-based inverted PSCs."
180,"Perovskite solar cells typically use TiO2 as charge extracting materials, which reduce the photostability of perovskite solar cells under illumination (including ultraviolet light). Simultaneously realizing the high efficiency and photostability, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed iron(III) oxide nanoisland electrodes consisting of discrete nanoislands in situ growth on the compact underlayer can be used as compatible and excellent electron extraction materials for perovskite solar cells. The uniquely designed iron(III) oxide electron extraction layer satisfies the good light transmittance and sufficient electron extraction ability, resulting in a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.2%. Most importantly, perovskite solar cells fabricated with iron(III) oxide show a significantly improved UV light and long-term operation stabilities compared with the widely used TiO2-based electron extraction material, owing to the low photocatalytic activity of iron(III) oxide. This study highlights the potential of incorporating new charge extraction materials in achieving photostable and high efficiency perovskite photovoltaic devices."
181,"For flexible perovskite solar cells, achieving high power conversion efficiency by using a room-temperature technology to fabricate a compact electron transport layer is one of the best options. Here, we develop an annealing-free, dopant-free, and amorphous tungsten oxide as electron transport layer by vacuum evaporation for flexible perovskite solar cells. The compact amorphous tungsten oxide electron transport layer with different thicknesses (0–50 nm) was directly deposited on flexible PEN/ITO substrate. A model of the improvement mechanism is proposed to understand how the thickness tailoring simultaneously enhances the crystallization and relaxes the trade-off between interface recombination and charge transfer. By optimizing the amorphous tungsten oxide thickness, the high homogeneous, uniform, and dense electron transport layer with a thickness of 30 nm is found to not only decrease the pinhole of the perovskite layer, but also enhance charge transport with reducing resistance. Furthermore, the mechanical bending stability revealed that, the fabricated perovskite solar cells show stable power conversion efficiency up to more than 1000 bending cycles. The room-temperature processed fabrication enables the amorphous tungsten oxide to become a potential electron transport layer candidate for the large-scale flexible perovskite solar cells, which becomes compatible with practical roll-to-roll solar cells manufacturing."
182,"Integrating a perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) into a hybrid system can convert solar energy into electricity by simultaneously utilizing the solar light and the waste heat produced from the PSC. Although such hybrid devices with a small area have been proposed, the fabrication of a large-area perovskite solar module (PSM) containing variable series and parallel connecting modes of subcells for the match with the same-size TEG still remain challenging. This work is to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a large-area (16 cm2) PSM-TEG device by hybridizing a PSM and a TEG in series. With the combination of series and parallel-connected modes of the PSC subcells, an optimal PSM-TEG device affords a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.7% with an open-circuit voltage of 6.80 V and a maximum power output of 103 mW under the irradiation of 100 mW/cm2 condition and maintains 85% of its initial PCE after 400 h under continuous illumination."
183,"Inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have superior moisture- and thermal-stability in comparison with organic-specie or/and I-containing devices. However, the narrow-spectra absorption (<550 nm) arising from their large bandgap of 2.3 eV for CsPbBr3 halide has markedly limited the further efficiency enhancement of corresponding inorganic device, therefore a great challenge is to broaden the light response range without sacrificing environmental tolerances. In this work, we constructively fabricate a CsPbBr3/bulk-heterojunction (organic J61-ITIC) photoactive layer to widen the optical absorption range of inorganic CsPbBr3 based interlayer-free device. Arising from the broadened light response wavelength from 550 to 780 nm and precisely optimized crystal lattice by incorporating Rb+ into CsPbBr3 film, the optimal device achieves a power conversion efficiency up to 10.34% under one sun illumination. Upon persistent attacks by heat of 80 °C (0% humidity) or 90% humidity (25 °C) over 40 days, the solar cell can still remain approximately 96% of initial efficiency, demonstrating the excellent stability for practical application."
184,"To fabricate efficient MAPbI3 perovskites using the Lewis acid-base adduct approach, we used a Lewis base hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) having a high donor number (DN), and investigated the effect of high-DN HMPA treatment on the properties of planar MAPbI3-based solar cells. The main functions of the HMPA treatment were to passivate the perovskites by forming well-distributed PbI2 phases and to densify the perovskites by controlling the rate constants. The treatment with Lewis base HMPA by one-step spin coating and subsequent solvent washing promoted the formation of pinhole-free perovskite films by increasing the coordination ability of HMPA with Pb2+ adducts and controlling the nucleation and growth rates of the perovskites. In addition, treatment with various concentrations of HMPA led to the formation of a residual PbI2 phase that acted as a passivation layer, even though stoichiometric quantities of precursors were used. Through a series of advanced electron microscopy studies, the exact three-dimensional locations of the PbI2 passivation layers were determined. Furthermore, by calculating the decreased active trap concentrations and carrier densities, we verified the passivation effect of remnant PbI2. Importantly, we achieved the best power conversion efficiency of 17.09% by the controlled addition of Lewis base HMPA, thus demonstrating a much improved performance than that obtained without HMPA treatment (15.73%)."
185,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25 % mainly have SnO2 or TiO2 as electron-transporting layers (ETLs). Now, zinc titanate (ZnTiO3, ZTO) is proposed as mesoporous ETLs owing to its weak photo-effect, excellent carrier extraction, and transfer properties. Uniform mesoporous films were obtained by spinning coating the ZTO ink and annealed below 150 °C. Photovoltaic devices based on Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite sandwiched between SnO2-mesorporous ZTO electrode and Spiro-OMeTAD layer achieved the PCE of 20.5 %. The PSCs retained more than 95 % of their original efficiency after 100 days lifetime test without being encapsulated. Additionally, the PSCs retained over 95 % of the initial performance when subjected at the maximum power point voltage for 120 h under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2), demonstrating superior working stability. The application of ZTO provides a better choice for ETLs of PSCs."
186,"Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites with appealing optoelectronic properties have attracted significant interest for photovoltaic application. The use of chloride (Cl–)-containing species to induce improved perovskite thin-film microstructures and improved optoelectronic properties is well-established. However, the mechanism for the formation of perovskite films with highly textured, micron-sized grains in the presence of Cl– is not well established. Using synchrotron-based in situ two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering complemented by scanning electron microscopy imaging, we present an oriented attachment mechanism via mineral bridge formation for the microstructural evolution of perovskite films post-treated with methylammonium chloride. We have identified the crucial role of the chlorine-containing intermediate phase as the mineral bridge, which enables the reorientation of primary, nanoscale perovskite grains followed by fusion into uniaxial oriented quasi-single crystal grains. The resulting perovskite films exhibit micron-sized grains with preferential orientation of the tetragonal (110) direction perpendicular to the substrate, resulting in improved solar cell efficiency attributed to improved charge collection. Our findings help to understand the fundamental mechanisms of microstructure evolution via soft processing in hybrid perovskite films."
187,"State-of-the-art Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells are grown with considerably substoichiometric Cu concentrations. The resulting defects, as well as potential improvements through increasing the Cu concentration, have been known in the field for many years. However, so far, cells with high Cu concentrations show decreased photovoltaic parameters. In this work, it is shown that RbF postdeposition treatment of CuInSe2 solar cells allows for capturing the benefits from the improved absorber quality with increasing Cu content. A reduced defect density and an increased doping level for cells with high Cu concentrations close to stoichiometry are demonstrated. Implementing a high mobility front transparent conductive oxide (TCO), the improved absorbers with 1.00 eV bandgap yield a solar cell efficiency of 19.2%, and combined with a perovskite top cell a 4-terminal tandem efficiency of 25.0% are demonstrated, surpassing the record efficiency of both subcell technologies."
188,"The optical properties of halide perovskite are already tuned in the initial solution by choosing the preferred precursors. However, it is not obvious that the optical properties change following perovskite crystallization; moreover, the mechanism in this case is not clear. Herein, it is shown that the optical properties are not necessarily “fixed” following perovskite crystallization. The phenomenon using the halide exchange process in the solid phase of an already crystalized perovskite is demonstrated. The effects of formamidinium iodide (FAI) and formamidinium bromide (FABr) are investigated post-treatment on the physical, optical, and PV properties of Cs0.2FA0.8Pb(I0.75Br0.25)3 perovskite. Various FAI/FABr ratios in the post-treatment solutions show that a halide exchange occurs in the solid-state phase following the crystallization of the perovskite film. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy line scan made on focused ion beam samples show that the bromide is present deep inside the film post-treatment, which supports the fact that the reaction is not occurring only on the surface. Charge extraction and voltage decay measurements of the complete solar cells support the structural changes due to the halide exchange. This work enhances the knowledge of halide exchange in already crystalized perovskite."
189,"Perovskites are promising solution processible materials widely used for solar cell application. We developed a vacuum-assisted deposition (VAD), which allowed spin-coating process under different vacuum conditions. Via two-step deposition for perovskite solution, VAD affects evaporation rate during deposition and perovskite formation. VAD improved all key properties necessary for optoelectronics like morphology, UV–visible absorption, and crystallinity along with UV, thermal, and moisture stability. Moreover, perovskite films became harder with VAD, paving the way for high mechanical stability. VAD opened a new door for high stability, dense perovskite films and could be adapted for various perovskite compositions for optoelectronic application."
190,"Perovskite solar cells are experiencing an unprecedented growth and might soon replace the conventional solar technologies. For inverted architecture cells, spin coated (SC) PEDOT:PSS has been widely implemented as hole transport material, but it has still unresolved issues regarding stability and scalability. In this work we deposited PEDOT:PSS layers by an alternative electrochemical (EC) route that offers precise synthesis control, scale-up potential and enhanced cell stability. The EC-PEDOT:PSS layers were deposited on ITO substrates from an aqueous solution of EDOT and NaPSS by cyclic voltammetry. Additionally, NaCl in different concentrations was added to the synthesis solution to tune the redox state of the polymer, as confirmed by UV-vis measurements. Photoluminescence emission spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite deposited on EC- and SC-PEDOT:PSS layers showed that both had a similar charge collection efficiency. Furthermore, SEM images demonstrated that MAPbI3 grew similarly on both films. Finally, inverted perovskite solar cells were fabricated using these layers. The results showed that 0.1 M NaCl doped EC-PEDOT:PSS performed similarly as the SC-PEDOT:PSS, achieving efficiencies as high as 11% and improved fill factors exceeding 80%. Most importantly, the EC-PEDOT:PSS significantly improved the stability of the cells, allowing the devices to maintain 90% of their average efficiency after 15 days."
191,"All-inorganic perovskite solar cells have developed rapidly in the last two years due to their excellent thermal and light stability. However, low efficiency and moisture instability limit their future commercial application. The mixed-halide inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite with a suitable bandgap offers a good balance between phase stability and light harvesting. However, high defect density and low carrier lifetime in CsPbI2Br perovskites limit the open-circuit voltage (Voc < 1.2 V), short-circuit current density (Jsc < 15 mA cm−2), and fill factor (FF < 75%) of CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells, resulting in an efficiency below 14%. For the first time, a CsPbI2Br perovskite is doped by Eu(Ac)3 to obtain a high-quality inorganic perovskite film with a low defect density and long carrier lifetime. A high efficiency of 15.25% (average efficiency of 14.88%), a respectable Voc of 1.25 V, a reasonable Jsc of 15.44 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 79.00% are realized for CsPbI2Br solar cells. Moreover, the CsPbI2Br solar cells with Eu(Ac)3 doping demonstrate excellent air stability and maintain more than 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) values after aging in air (relative humidity: 35–40%) for 30 days."
192,"The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of hole-transporting polymeric materials was tuned by postfunctionalization based on a highly-efficient [2 + 2] cycloaddition-retroelectrocyclization (CA-RE) reaction. After the CA-RE reaction, the HOMO level of an aromatic polyamine, determined by the electrochemical first oxidation potential, was lowered from −5.30 eV to −5.37 eV. This enabled the smooth hole injection from the perovskite layer of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells. Although the hole mobility of the aromatic polyamine, determined by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method, decreased by this postfunctionalization, the energy level adjustment was more significant for the improvement of the solar cell performances. The device based on the postfunctionalized polyamine with the HOMO level of −5.37 eV showed more than twice the photoconversion efficiency than that based on the precursor polyamine with the HOMO level of −5.30 eV."
193,"Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that can be entirely processed at low temperatures have attracted growing attention due to their cost-effective production. Hole-transport materials (HTMs) play an essential role in achieving efficient inverted PSCs, as they determine the effectiveness of charge extraction and recombination at interfaces. Herein, three polyfluorene copolymers (TFB, PFB, and PFO) are investigated as HTMs for construction of inverted PSCs. It is found that the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells is closely correlated with the electronic properties of the HTMs. Due to its high mobility along with the favored energy-level alignment with perovskite, TFB shows superior charge extraction and suppressed interfacial recombination than PFB- and PFO-based devices, which delivers a high efficiency of 18.48% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of up to 1.1 V. In contrast, the presence of a large energy barrier in the PFO-based devices results in substantial losses in both VOC and photocurrent. These results demonstrate that TFB can serve as a superior HTM for inverted PSCs. Moreover, it is anticipated that the performance of the three HTMs identified here might guide the molecular design of novel HTMs for the manufacture of highly efficient inverted PSCs."
194,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising renewable light-harvesting technologies with high performance, but the utilization of hazardous dopants and high boiling additives is harmful to all forms of life and the environment. Herein, new multirole π-conjugated polymers (P1–P3) are developed via a rational design approach through theoretical hindsight, further successfully subjecting them into dopant-free PSCs as hole-transporting materials and additive-free OSCs as photoactive donors, respectively. Especially, P3-based PSCs and OSCs not only show high power conversion efficiencies of 17.28% and 8.26%, but also display an excellent ambient stability up to 30 d (for PSCs only), owing to their inherent superior optoelectronic properties in their pristine form. Overall, the rational approach promises to support the development of environmentally and economically sustainable PSCs and OSCs."
195,"CsPbBr3 based perovskite solar cells draw boosted investigation benefitting from their simplified preparation property and outstanding stability against moist and heat while the photo-electrical conversion efficiency (PCE) is still worth promotion. In addition, relatively wide band gap limits the light utilization ability of pristine CsPbBr3 which leads to insufficient photo-induced charge carrier population thereby a low photocurrent density. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate a strategy to combine crystalized Si quantum dots (QDs) with CsPbBr3 inverse opal (IO) which significantly enhances the solar energy utilization efficiency by virtue of providing an additional fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from Si QDs to CsPbBr3 IO. Acting as donor, the emitted photoluminescence from Si QDs can be absorbed by CsPbBr3, which serves as acceptor, leading to an increased carrier population in the system. Meanwhile, the multi-dimensional heterojunction between Si QDs and CsPbBr3 IO effectively facilitates the system bulk charge transfer process. A greatly improved PCE up to 8.31% with an obviously enhanced photocurrent density up to 7.8 mA⋅cm−2 can be obtained with a competitive IPCE up to 81%. This strategy provides a new alternative method to develop high-performance perovskite solar cells and other photo-electronic devices."
196,"Layered quasi-2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) prevent oxygen and moisture permeation, for long-lifetime photovoltaic performance. Unfortunately, the electrical and photoinduced surface and dipolar polarizations caused due to the presence of the organic cation spacer in the structure remain unclear. Herein, a high-performance planar quasi-2D OIHP solar cell comprising (PEA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) is designed. It displays a large area coverage and an interconnected nanorod network, which contributes to efficient light absorption and charge carrier transport. The surface and dipolar polarizations exhibit remarkable light intensity and electric field–dependent characteristics at short-circuit-current (Jsc) and steady-state (i.e., Voc) conditions. More importantly, exhibits a nonlinear behavior at steady states. Such a unique feature is in accordance with the dipolar polarization measured at the same condition. The phenomenon can be explained by the significant dipole–dipole interaction at lower electric field strengths. At higher field strengths, the screen of the dipoles due to charge accumulation at the surface of the organic cation spacer leads to slower increment of . Thus, carefully designing the quasi-2D perovskite nanostructure, together with the dielectric property of the organic cation spacer, may play an exceptionally important role for future high-performance quasi-2D perovskite solar cells."
197,"Large-area polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with variably sized moth-eye structures were fabricated to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. An approach that incorporated photolithography, bilayer PDMS deposition and replication was used in the fabrication process. By simply attaching the moth-eye PDMS films to the transparent substrates of perovskite solar cells, the optical properties of the devices could be tuned by changing the size of the moth-eye structures. The device with 300-nm moth-eye PDMS films greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency of ~ 21% due to the antireflective effect of the moth-eye structure. Furthermore, beautiful coloration was observed on the 1000-nm moth-eye PDMS films through optical interference caused by the diffraction grating effect. Our results imply that moth-eye PDMS films can greatly enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and building-integrated photovoltaics."
198,"The most critical reason for limiting the extensive study and promotion of MA-based perovskites is their intrinsic instability when compared to FA-based perovskites. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple and effective method to improve their intrinsic stability. Herein, the 1,1,1-trimethylhydrazinium cation (TMH+) was first introduced into MAPbI3 to fabricate high-performance mixed-cation perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, which benefits by the improved crystallization and morphology of films. On the one hand, the slightly large size of TMH+ is complementary to the low tolerance factor of MAPbI3 and then enhances the structure stability. On the other hand, the presence of methyl groups in TMH+ is beneficial to promote the hydrophobicity of MA-based perovskite. More importantly, the hydrazinium group can effectively inhibit the production of Pb0 in perovskites, which is the initial stage of degradation. As a result, the intrinsic stability of PSCs has been observably boosted. After aging at 45 ± 5% RH for 1800 h and 85 °C for 200 h, the unencapsulated PSCs retained 77 and 79% of initial PCE, respectively. This work provides a new design for the selection of suitable cations with special structures and chemical groups to enhance the moisture resistance and intrinsic stability of MA-based perovskite at the source of degradation."
199,"The fundamental parameters of majority and minority charge carriers—including their type, density and mobility—govern the performance of semiconductor devices yet can be difficult to measure. Although the Hall measurement technique is currently the standard for extracting the properties of majority carriers, those of minority carriers have typically only been accessible through the application of separate techniques. Here we demonstrate an extension to the classic Hall measurement—a carrier-resolved photo-Hall technique—that enables us to simultaneously obtain the mobility and concentration of both majority and minority carriers, as well as the recombination lifetime, diffusion length and recombination coefficient. This is enabled by advances in a.c.-field Hall measurement using a rotating parallel dipole line system and an equation, ΔμH = d(σ2H)/dσ, which relates the hole–electron Hall mobility difference (ΔμH), the conductivity (σ) and the Hall coefficient (H). We apply this technique to various solar absorbers—including high-performance lead-iodide-based perovskites—and demonstrate simultaneous access to majority and minority carrier parameters and map the results against varying light intensities. This information, which is buried within the photo-Hall measurement1,2, had remained inaccessible since the original discovery of the Hall effect in 18793. The simultaneous measurement of majority and minority carriers should have broad applications, including in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices."
200,"The mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle-based scaffold structure is the best electron transport layer (ETL) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and is still used in most PSCs with optimal photovoltaic characteristics. However, the high sintering temperature of TiO2 nanoparticles required to remove binders from the TiO2 paste limits PSC application to flexible electronics. In this study, a simple interface modification process involving ethanol rinsing is developed to enhance the photovoltaic characteristics of low-temperature processed PSCs. This easy and fast technique could enable remarkable performance by PSCs by significantly increasing the fill factor and current density, leading to a power conversion efficiency more than four times that of untreated solar cells"
201,"A series of naphthalene diimide (NDI) based n-type conjugated polymers with amino-functionalized side groups and backbones were synthesized and used as cathode interlayers (CILs) in polymer and perovskite solar cells. Because of controllable amine side groups, all the resulting polymers exhibited distinct electronic properties such as oxidation potential of side chains, charge carrier mobilities, self-doping behaviors, and interfacial dipoles. The influences of the chemical variation of amine groups on the cathode interfacial effects were further investigated in both polymer and perovskite solar cells. We found that the decreased electron-donating property and enhanced steric hindrance of amine side groups substantially weaken the capacities of altering the work function of the cathode and trap passivation of the perovskite film, which induced ineffective interfacial modifications and declining device performance. Moreover, with further improvement of the backbone design through the incorporation of a rigid acetylene spacer, the resulting polymers substantially exhibited an enhanced electron-transporting property. Upon use as CILs, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.1% and 15.2% were, respectively, achieved in polymer and perovskite solar cells. Importantly, these newly developed n-type polymers were allowed to be processed over a broad thickness range of CILs in photovoltaic devices, and a prominent PCE of over 8% for polymer solar cells and 13.5% for perovskite solar cells can be achieved with the thick interlayers over 100 nm, which is beneficial for roll-to-roll coating processes. Our findings contribute toward a better understanding of the structure–performance relationship between CIL material design and solar cell performance, and provide important insights and guidelines for the design of high-performance n-type CIL materials for organic and perovskite optoelectronic devices."
